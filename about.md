Hello! Welcome to my online Lab Notebook as I navigate the waters of Graduate School. I am a Masters of Science candidate in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle. 

### Research
I am investigating the effects of temperature and disease (Bitter Crab disease caused by parasitic dinoflagellate _Hematodinium spp._) on the genetic expression of Alaskan Tanner Crabs (_Chionoecetes bairdi_).
