title: Lab day 2 - Homogenization & Sonication
---

## Today's lab work involved homogenizing the tissue in solution, then sonicating to lyse the cells. 

### Homogenization

Added 500 µl 50 mM NH4HCO3 + 6M urea solution that we made the day prior to each sample; homogenize tissue using pestle.  
 * I did not spin the sample down to remove supernatant, as I am only working with tissue. Should I have larvae, or other sample with shell, I'll need to do that, as per the protocol.  
 * **At this point I _should have_ kept the samples on wet ice until sonication, but was following a protocol that did not outline that in detail. This needs to be updated in the protocol.**  

### Sonication

Walked over to the Genome Science Building with samples, dry ice, and wet ice. Working with Emma, made an ethanol dry-ice bath by getting a small plastic container and filling with ethanol to dip samples in one at a time. Slowly added small chunks of dry-ice until they are not dissolving very fast; kept adding dry ice throughout the sonication to maintain "bubbles"
Sonicated each sample three times, but not in a row. 
 * First round: 5 seconds (should have been 10 seconds, but I had received conflicting direction).
 * Second & Third round: 10 seconds
 * After sonicating, dipped sample in ethanol + dry ice for 5s, and wedged the tube into wet ice until next sonication.
 * Between samples, dipped the sonicating probe into 1) ethanol 2) nanopure, and 3) nanopure; rinsed again with ethanol, and dried with a kimwipe.
 * After completed with sonication, kept samples on dry ice for ~1 hr, then moved to wet ice (realized that it needed to be thawed for the next step) 

Brought samples back to our lab, and aliquoted 11ul of each sample to a new labeled tube for BCA assay. Saved remainder for mini-trypsin digestion. Stored all tubes at -80°C.

**Next time, keep samples on wet ice throughout the day, rather than dry ice, to keep cold but not freeze**
