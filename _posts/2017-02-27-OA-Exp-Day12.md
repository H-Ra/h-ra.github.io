title: OA Exp. Day 12
---

We check on our oysters every Monday and Wednesday.  Mondays are minimum effort days, where we clean filters, collect water chemistry samples and measurements, clean algae lines with bleach, and make sure everything is flowing and pH/T are stable.  Yaamini and I are dividing duties, so I'll post links to her notebook when she goes out and I don't. 

This is one of those days: [Manchester Day 12](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Manchester-Day-12/) - thanks Yaamini!
