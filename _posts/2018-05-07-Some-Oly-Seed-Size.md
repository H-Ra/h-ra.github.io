### 9 months later ... where are they now?
 
I measured four of my Olympia oyster seed batches from the 2017 experiment. This is seed I produced from broodstock that were exposed to two pH treatments (7.3, 7.8) prior to reproductive conditioning (check out [this repo README]()). Measured thus far are 385 oysters from each of the following groups:  
   1. North Sound, 6-degree low pH 
   2. North Sound, 6-degree ambient pH 
   3. Hood Canal, 6-degree low pH 
   4. Hood Canal, 6-degree ambient pH 
   
Takeaway - adult oysters exposed to low pH prior to reproductive conditioning produced less viable larvae (measured via survival to post-set), and carry-over effect persists to 9-month juvenile stage as size is significantly lower. 
 
 ### As a reminder here's surival for the North Sound and Hood Canal groups:

### Here's the new data, which is size (mm) at ~9 months:
