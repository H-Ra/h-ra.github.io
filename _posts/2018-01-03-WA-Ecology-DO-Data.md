title: DO Data from WA Ecology
---

## In an effort to QC the dissolved oxygen data from the DNR geoduck outplant, I checked out WA Ecology's online tool, the [Environmental Information Management (EIM) System](https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/eimreporting/Default.aspx).  

### Here's the website layout. I opted to search under the **Results** field

### After experimenting a bit with search options, I searched for "dissolved oxygen":

### Here is a shot of the results table. I then downloaded all results.

### The downloaded results file was a .csv. I opened in Excel and generated 2 histograms: 1) All DO data points measured in mg/L; 2) All DO data points measured in mg/L AND measurements from marine/salt/brackish water.

### Main take-away: All DO data ranged from 0-21 mg/L, therefore the data points in the DNR dataset >21 should not be included in my data analysis.
