### Counted algae on broodstock manifolds, cleaned setters, SN exp. water change, new larvae, imaged growth exp. 

#### Steven joined me on this Saturday and helpd attended the gigas and helped me clean/screen larvae and buckets. Thanks Steven!

#### Cleaned outside downwellers
Upon arrival the outside silos were filthy, with a fine green film coating the bottom and clogging it; water levels were very high in the silos, but were not overflowing (phew).  I rinsed the silos with fresh water, drained the tank fully and sprayed it with fresh water, and refilled. Fearing the film had cause mortality, I took a look at one population, K-10 Low. They look good! There are several juvenile seed at different sizes (see image). This group was one of the first to spawn, so the seed is one of the oldest. I did not look through the rest.

#### Cleaned inside setters
Pulled all silos, screened onto a 224um screen to remove anything <224, cleaned silos and put setters back. This was an effort to clean in preparation for the next batch of new 224 larvae on Monday.

#### New larvae
Still very few newly spawned larvae. Also, cleaned out all larval catchment buckets.

#### Counted broodstock's inflowing algae
Collected inflowing water from each broodstock's dripper, and using hemocytometer I counted algae cells. Protocol: shoot bottle to mix, pulled 20uL 2x, injecting into both ends of the hemocytometer. Counted **all cells** in 3mmx3mm square (2 reps). Algae counts are below; I was happy to see that there wasn't an enormous difference between top and bottom shelf of the small table, where the K & HL broodstock have been housed.  Also, remember that I have randomly been moving all buckets around within their designated table/shelf.

#### SN experiment water change
Notice again the density was low, so I used 1900 mL of algae to acheive ~100k cells/mL
