title: May 2018 goals
---

### 1 month left in Seattle before shipping off to AU. Here are things that need to be done:  

#### Finish DNR paper  
  - Finish editing discussion & conclusion  
  - With newfound knowledge make sure my stats are sound   
  - Finalize map & plots  
  - Move all pertinent data/scripts/plots over to new clean repo  

#### 2017 Oly paper  
  - Finish measuring seed @ dock (time consuming, 2-person job) (2017 Oly project)  
  - Make headway  

#### Transgenerational OA Oly project (using 2017 seed): 
  - Finish prepping small bags of seed to be deployed in eelgrass bed design  
  - Figure out logistics for deploying 2017 seed in eelgrass - when to go out, where, when to retrieve - if prior to mid September, need to get someone to do this for me.  

#### 2018 Oly project   
  - Collect recruitment data from 2018 Oly project (this wil be completed by 5/24) - **image for size if possible**.  
  - Build mesh bags and figure out/execute where to hang my new seed.  
  - Send remaining histology cassettes off for processing - ASAP.  

#### Miscellaneous: 
  - Prep for committee meeting  
  - Send Polydora paper to potential collaborators for feedback  

### Things that will be on the back burner until I get back, or that an undergrad could do:  

#### 2018 Oly project: 
  - Analyze 2018 Oly histology slides for sex, stage, and observations  
  - Image frozen larvae and measure for size; focus on those groups that I grew (48 samples)  
  - Process larval samples for lipid content  
  - Process gonad samples for lipid & glycogen  
  
#### 2017 Oly project: 
  - Image frozen larvae from this experiment and use ImageJ to measure size upon release - not sure if this is worth our time, but it could be interesting ...
