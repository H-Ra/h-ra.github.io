### April 13th, 2017: Returned to Manchester solo to sample the K population (Katherine's oysters spawned in 2015)

#### Time-frame
Wow, I made good time! Arrived at 8:00 AM, was finished at 4:30 PM, included a 30-minute lunch break. Sampled 60 oysters from 4 treatments (12 bags).

#### Sampling scheme 
Shucked and pulled 5 tissue samples from each oyster: 
  * Flash-frozen in ethanol/dry ice bath, and stored in -80 in Rickâ€™s Lab: Mantle (M), Ctenidia (C), Adductor (A)
  * Excess tissue (any type) for DNA (E), stored in 1 mL ethanol and placed in fridge in rm 209
  * Visceral Mass for Histology, oriented with right valve facing up, left valve facing down - the section will be taken from the left-valve side, which is the side not likely injured by the act of shucking.

      | Tube Label         | Population | Treatment             | # Sampled  |
      |--------------------|------------|-----------------------|------------|
      | K-6-16 to K-6-30   | K          | chilled T, low pH     | 15 (5/rep) |
      | K-6-31 to K-6-45   | K          | chilled T, ambient pH | 15 (5/rep) |
      | K-10-16 to K-10-30 | K          | ambient T, low pH     | 15 (5/rep) |
      | K-10-31 to K-10-45 | K          | ambient T, ambient pH | 15 (5/rep) |

#### How ripe are these 2 year old oysters?
I was interested to see if any of these oysters would show developed gonads. A few did (the larger ones), but many did not.  Here are some snap shots of what I saw:
