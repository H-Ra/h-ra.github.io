Big Screening Day. Had help from Grace, Steven, and Yaamini. Screened all larval buckets through 224 & 180um, and caught the rest on 100um. Larvae that held on 224um screen were moved to the downwelling setting tanks with microcultch at 224um.  The SN & NF groups were split into two buckets, 180um and 100um (aka 180um < x <224um, and 100um < X < 180um).  I did not split the HL & K groups (limited on materials and space). 

Screened through the SN-10 Ambient A group in bucket #2 (I had reserved these yesterday in a 2nd bucket), and added that to the 100um group. 

Here's a snapshot of the data from today:

All larvae were sampled into well plates (#1-7) then fixed with Lugols. UPDATE: I imaged these on 6/9. **I did not, and will not hence forth, image the empty cells. Un-imaged cells are noted in my physical lab notebook.**

Collected new larvae from: 
  * SN-6 Ambient B
  * NF-6 Low B
  * NF-6 Low A
  * K-10 Low
