## Qubit

I followed the protocol for Qubit to see if the two samples I processed on Friday contain any RNA.

Unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to which sample was first, so I don't know which one was out of range. But, one of them was out of range, and one of them had a concentration of 4.04 ng/µL.

I used 5µL of sample. So what does this mean?
2 things:
1. I should use more µL of sample (I can use between 1 and 20µL. Sam recommended I start between 1 and 5 µL)
2. There wasn't any RNA in the sample that was "out of range".

I think the only way to tell whether there was RNA or not would be to do it again, but with more µL of sample.
