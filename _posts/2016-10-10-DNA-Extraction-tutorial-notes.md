title: DNA Extraction quick n' dirty (beginning steps)
---

Last week I shadowed Hollie while she performed the first few steps of DNA extraction. Here's what I learned about the process and general tips for working in that lab:

* Wear protective clothes at all time
* Leave a "dirty" notebook/pen set in the lab
  * Need to get a lab coat -> can purchase things at the Chem. building's stock room; need to use UW account and a project #.
* Extracting process = ~2hrs
* Extracting + quant. & qual. analysis = all day

**Preparing workspace/materials:** 
 
* Turn on heat block  
* Get dry ice in small styrofoam cooler  
* Wipe down station & all materials with "ELIMINase" -> this cleans enzymes/DNA from station  
* Prep vials:  
  * Centrifuge can fit up to 24 vials, so Hollie processes 24max/day 
  * Pour vials onto clean workspace, close caps, set into tray   
  * Select samples; **randomize** selection at each step to avoid batch effects.  
  * Label vials  
* Prep scoops/tool that will be used to measure sample amount; in this case Hollie had homogenized the geoduck into a frozen powder.
  * Soak/sterilize in ELIMINase
  * Rinse in DEPC/DI H20 
  * Hold scoops/tool in sterilized falcon tube on dry ice 
 
**Work from DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit**   

  * Check dates on kit and if ethanol has been added to chems.  
  * Pipette in Proteinase K chemical (pretty viscous, so do this one first); 180 ul/<25mg tissue
  * Vortex then spin briefly to get chem to bottom of vial
  * Add 180 ul ATL Buffer (not touching vial with pipette tip) -> this lyses the cells
  
**Transfer sample to vials**

* Take dry ice to -80 freezer; pull desired samples and put directly onto dry ice. Minimize time out of freezer/off ice: seconds matter for RNA; minutes matter for DNA
  * It's important to organize tubes when storing to make pulling desired sample easy
* Put ~25mg of sample into vials using prepared scoops/tools
* Incubate at 56degC for ~1hr; should turn from clear to ~greenish (for geoduck samples)
* Add 200ul AL buffer to all samples; vortex to mix
  * Incubate for ~10mins to avoid precipitation
* Label columns
* Transfer incubated samples into columns using pipette
  * Hopefully all of the sample volume fits into the column at once; if not, then may need to centrifuge, then add the rest.
* Centrifuge @ 6000 for 1min
* Add 500 ul AW1; centrifuge & discard waste & waste-catching outer tube
* Add 500ul AW2; centrifuge & discard waste & tube  

At this point the DNA is affixed to the column. 

**This is where I had to leave; will shadow again for remainder of steps**
