### Screening day, preserved growth exp. larvae, changed growth exp water, collected new, cleaned downwellers.
Just me and Grace today, but all was very manageable. 

#### Cleaned outside downwellers
Again, green film is clogging the silos; rinsed with fresh. Lesson learned: do NOT use tetraselmis algae (the green one). It's large, and clogges everything. I spoke with Stuart, and he has agreed to not feed any of my system Tet moving forward.

#### Screened larvae
Larvae numbers are dwindling.  High mortality last week, as well as minimal newly spawned larvae, equals extremely low counts. 
[screening data here as soon as I digitize]

#### New Larvae

I had previously planned to cease stocking new larvae on 6/30, BUT this group, NF10 Low, had an enormously high mortality event so I opted to keep these ~40k larvae and move them through to (hopefully) set. 

#### Water change on SN growth exp

#### Transferred all SN growth exp larvae into tubes for safe keeping
As advised by Katherine, I had Grace transfer all the SN growth experiment sampled larvae from 6/22 & 6/29 into labeled tubes. Grace labeled them with date and well #; well #'s corresponding treatment and rep are located on my master larval data spreadsheet. NOTE: I do not have saved larvae from time 0 (6/15), as I did not have the forethought to do so. 

#### Running list of lessons learned:
  * trust but verify
  * be explicit
  * avoid Tetraselmis
  * cull all groups 

Consideration: was it necessary to have 2 spawning groups per treatment, given the long time-frame? AKA is it realistic that one male would fertilize all females over 2 months?
