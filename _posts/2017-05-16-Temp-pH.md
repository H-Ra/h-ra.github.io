title: Downloaded T & pH Data
---

The Avtech system allows me to download 30 days of data; I did so today, capturing [pH](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Stress/blob/master/Data/Oly%20pH_2017-04-24_to_05-16.csv) & [T](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Stress/blob/master/Data/Oly%20Temps_2017-04-24_to_05-16.csv) data from 4/24 -> 5/16 @ ~1:30pm. 

**Notes:** 
  * Temp-w-3 probe is in the header tank
  * wish-Internal Temperature is recording the room temp
  * Durafet 3 is on the top shelf in a K population bucket. The top shelf houses HL & K groups, and receives a large amount of air bubbles, which I believe is driving the pH up to ~8 as it mixes with ambient air.
