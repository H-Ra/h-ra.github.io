Screening day and more! Things went very smoothly today. Grace, Olivia and I make a good team.

### Arrival inspection:

- Banjos very dirt, a few pseudo-clogged. Due to heavy use of Tet algae.
- HL-10 Ambient, which spawned, banjo overflowing but luckily lots was caught in an empty trio pour that was sitting adjacent to the catchment bucket

### Screened larvae (Olivia, Grace, and me).

- Mortality ranged dramatically between groups. Very high mortality in the following groups:
        - SN-6 Low 180um - lots of ciliates present
        - SN-10 Low 224um, 180um - lots of ciliates present
        - NF-10 Low 224um, 180um

### Collected new larvae, counted, stocked, and sampled. Grace did the majority of this process today.

### Cleaned gigas (Olivia)

- Drained all three tanks, cleaned with vortex- LOTS of stringy stuff in the top tank w/o animals. I now am certain that the mucus is a result of the Reed’s paste, and not coming from the animals:

- Rinsed gigas, checked for morts - there were none.
- Refilled tanks, then turned off flow and allowed header temp to increase.
- Grace adjusted flow for 1.2 L/Min on each side.
- Increased set point temp to 21degC.
- Fed with 490mL Reed’s paste
- Installed new pump (had been using small PSRF pump).

### Cleaned Broodstock (Olivia):

- First, recorded broodstock location on manifold
- [image here]
- Dumped all broodstock & larval catchment buckets, rinsed oysters, cleaned buckets with vortex.

### Larval experiment water change:

Katherine recommends having 5 replicates.
  - [insert Katherine’s post here]
- I heeded her advice, and thus split my 3 reps into 5 via the following:
  - Math!:
      - Assuming 800 larvae in each tripour, total # larvae per treatment = 800*3 = 2,400
      - Larvae per rep for 5-reps = 2,400/5 = 480
      - larvae to remove from each tripour = 800-480 = 320. Split these up into 2 new silos = 160 larvae per new silo per triplicate
  - How this was done:
      - Set 2 new silos in FSW. Label with designated treatment group.
      - Working 1 silo at a time, transfer larvae to a tripour, fill to 200mL
          - mL needed per new silo = 800 larvae/200 mL = 4 larvae/mL, 160 larvae / l/mL = 40 mL
      - Plunge 20 times, pour 40mL into 2 falcon tubes. Add the contents into the two silos.
      - Repeat with other 2 triplicates.
      - Result:
          - 2 new silos will have 160*3 larvae = 480
          - Original silos will have 800-(2*160) = 480
  - New setup:

  - Changed water.
      - Filled a 5-gal bucket with 18L.
      - Harvested 450mL Tiso, CGW & counted density:

  - Mimicking Katherine’s experiment, I will sample & image larvae on Thursday 6/22 (day 7), then also on 6/29 (day 14)
  - Reminder: I’m working with the 4 treatment groups in the South Sound (SN) population.
