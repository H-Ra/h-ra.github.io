## RNA isolation

I (hopefully) successfully isolated RNA from samples 465 and 468 today! 

I followed exactly what I posted on [Tuesday](https://github.com/grace-ac/grace-ac.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-02-13-RNA-isolation-protocol-for-tomorrow.md). I have some clarifications to add to it, though, that Sam helped me with.

#### Next week:
Use Qubit to determine if I actuallly got any RNA in the two samples tubes!
