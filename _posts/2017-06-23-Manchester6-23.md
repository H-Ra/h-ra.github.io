### Looked at downwellers for set, fixed growth exp. larvae from yesterday

#### Viewed setters under scope to assess success rate

Temp of setters outside: 17degC, looking good!
Out of interest, I screened through all the silos outside to see if I have any successful setters, and to give them a good cleaning.  Here are some qualitative notes of each group. Unless noted, the set were very new and had yet to put down much juvenlile shell:
  * NF10 Ambient: Some set; some larvae; some morts
  * NF6 Low:      A few good set; few larvae; few morts
  * SN10 Low:     A couple set; very few larvae; loads of morts
  * NF10 Low:     Very vew set or larvae; mostly morts
  * SN10 Mix:     A ton of set and larvae; some morts.  Lots set on side of silo.
  * SN6 Low:      A few set; several larvae; several morts
  * NF6 Ambient:  A ton of set; some larvae; a few morts.  Lots set on side of silo, and some larve set/juveniles visible.
  * K6 Low:       A couple set; a few larvae; a few morts. I see 1 older set, but very few larvae total.
  * HL10 Ambient: Lots of set and larvae; some set on side of silo
  * HL10 Low:     Lots of set; a few larvae; some set on side of silo
  * K10 Ambient:  Some set; some larvae; some morts
  * K6 Ambient:   Some set, some larvae, some morts. I see 1 large juvenile
  * K10 Low:      A few old set, a couple larvae with feet, some morts
 
 So all in all things look like they are progression. I am worried about the following groups: SN10 Low, NF10 Low, K6 Low. Here are some images of the setters, for reference:

SN10 Low: very few set, lots of empty shells

#### Water change on growth exp
Harvested from same algae cocktail as yesterday; mixed 520mL cocktail into 18L water.

#### Fixed larvae from growth exp
I hoped that the larvae would relax enough in the fridge to image today. This was note the case, they were still very active.  So, I fixed them in ethanol. This is not the best way to do it; I will modify my methods for next time: 
  * Transferred larvae/fsw from well plate into 2mL test tubes
  * Removed supernatant with pipette, being careful not to remove larvae 
  * Added 1.5mL 200 proof ethanol to fix

#### New Larvae
There were some new larvae in SN10 Low A & HL10 Low, but I did not have time to collect today.
