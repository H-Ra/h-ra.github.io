title: October Goals

This is vast. Lots to do.

### Small To Do:

- [ ] Email Abigail re: GROW program
- [ ] Submit back-log of reimbursements for Manchester & shellfish club
- [ ] Email re: Oly session @ NSA 2018 - deadline FRIDAY
- [ ] Register for Parasites once add code comes through
- [ ] Book return ferries @ 7am on Friday! 
- [ ] Learn how to tag notebook posts
- [ ] Take geoduck proteomics poster to WA Co-op once location confirmed (I think SAFS somewhere)

### Large To-Do:

#### Geoduck proteomics
 - [ ] Clean up scripts from SRM analysis
 - [ ] Quickly summarize everything done to raw data for analysis so I don't forget
     - [ ] DIA
     - [ ] SRM
 - [ ] Figure out which vials to throw away from SRM run:
     * “D"
     * “E"
     * Autosampler vials (highly unlikely we’ll need these again)
     * KEEP: completely digested peptides (“F”), other 1/2 of sample not digested, is there another vial of quantifed but un-digested proteins? 
  * More analysis for SRM:
     - [ ] Figure out how to calculate distances between tech reps, to numerically validate my removal of poor-quality reps
     - [ ] Generate Linear Response Plot, as per Emma:  Peak area on the y, amount of peptide (moles) on the x. Don't know absolute quantity of experimental peptides, could make the x-axis relative quantity or something. Can generate plots like these in MSstats.
     * Determine if abundance difference is “biologically relevant,” aka look to lit for abundance values to see what is low, normal, high (if possible!)
     - [ ] See if I can bring DIA results into SRM analysis (at very least, compare 3 proteins in DIA data)
     - [ ] Consider implications: HSP70 is not highly specific, since some interference w/ gigas in dilution curve
 * Start drafting geoduck proteomics 
     - [ ] utline everything
     - [ ] Methods detailed
     - [ ] Full lit review
     
#### Record podcast pilot with Megan 
 - [ ] Read Megan’s paper
 - [ ] Rent mic from UW tech resources for this 
 - [ ] Where to record? 

#### Oly genetics hatchery vs. wild
    - [ ] Meet with Brent re: Oly genetics paper, see if he has scripts for calling loci
    - [ ] Gather existing write-up for 1st genetic testing

#### Application things
- [ ] Start drafting GROW application
   - [ ] Get project description from Abigail
 - [ ] NDSEG
 - [ ] NSA travel grant, other?
 - [ ] Dive grant: http://www.wdhof.org/wdhof-scholarshipDesc.aspx
 - [ ] UW FINS for Vegas ?
 
#### Oly experiment:
 - [ ] Make sure I'm organized
 - [ ] Write-up 1-stop shopping list of Oly project including:
     - [ ] Experiment summary
     - [ ] Samples collected
     - [ ] Data collected
     - [ ] Treatments, populations, etc.
 - [ ] Figure out how/when to transport Oly samples from Manchester/Rick’s -80
 - [ ] Meet with STATS resource to figure out how to analyze Oly larval survival - parse out survival data to 224um, to juvenile, by time for reps
 
#### For Committee: 
 - [ ] Schedule 1st meeting - mid October
 - [ ] Complete committee sheet for SAFS
 - [ ] Complete academic timeline 
 - [ ] Presentation for committee meeting: 20-30 mins, to include:
     * Overall goals of PhD
         * Research interests
         * Motivation
         * Post-graduation ideals
     * Proposed timeline, travel, etc.
     * What I’ve done to date
         * Chapter 1 - Proteomics
         * Chapter 2 - Oly OA/T experiment Generation 1
     * What I plan to do
         * Chapter X - Oly OA/T experiment Generation 2
         * Chapter X - Oly OA/T experiment, wild generation OR hatchery-produced F1’s (repeat experiment, using silos only for larvae!)
         * Chapter X - Oly genetics wild vs. hatchery (?)
         * Chapter X - Project in Australia on reproductive peptides
         * Chapter X - Could I do a geoduck genetics wild vs. hatchery? (or, what is “baseline”?)
     * Grants & Fellowships
     * Extra curriculars
