title: October Goals
---

This is vast. Lots to do.

### Small To Do:

- [X] Email Abigail re: GROW program
- [X] Submit back-log of reimbursements for Manchester & shellfish club
- [X] Email re: Oly session @ NSA 2018 - deadline FRIDAY
- [X] Register for Parasites once add code comes through
- [X] Book return ferries @ 7am on Friday! 
- [ ] Learn how to tag notebook posts
- [X] Take geoduck proteomics poster to WA Co-op once location confirmed (I think SAFS somewhere)
- [X] Submit geoduck project presentation for GSS
- [ ] Throw away some geoduck vials (E, F, autosampler vials) & organize others (original samples, quantified proteins, digested peptides)

### Large To-Do:

#### Geoduck proteomics
 - [X] Clean up scripts from SRM analysis
 - [ ] Quickly summarize everything done to raw data for analysis so I don't forget
     - [ ] DIA
     - [X] SRM - done via Jupyter Notebook 
 - [X] Figure out which vials to throw away from SRM run:
     * Throw away: “D", “E", Autosampler vials (highly unlikely we'll use these again, since they sat around and not enough volume to re-run, and PRTC was messed up 
     * KEEP: 1) other 1/2 of sample not digested, 2) protein in solution from quantification step, 3) completely digested peptides (“F”)
  * More analysis for SRM:
     - [X] Figure out how to calculate distances between tech reps, to numerically validate my removal of poor-quality reps
     - [ ] Generate Linear Response Plot, as per Emma:  Peak area on the y, amount of peptide (moles) on the x. Don't know absolute quantity of experimental peptides, could make the x-axis relative quantity or something. Can generate plots like these in MSstats.
     * Determine if abundance difference is “biologically relevant,” aka look to lit for abundance values to see what is low, normal, high (if possible!)
     - [ ] See if I can bring DIA results into SRM analysis (at very least, compare 3 proteins in DIA data)
     - [ ] Consider implications: HSP70 is not highly specific, since some interference w/ gigas in dilution curve
 * Start drafting geoduck proteomics paper
     - [ ] Outline everything
     - [X] SRM Methods detailed
     - [ ] DIA Methods detailed
     - [ ] Full lit review
 * Document steps from Vantage -> Replicate Review. Write notebooks for: 
     - [X] How to create Skyline project file with .raw SRM data including PRTC
     - [X] Calculating predicted RT 
     - [X] Pick peaks & adjust retention time ranges using predicted RT
     - [X] Remove peaks, replicates, and transitions/peptides that are poor quality, as determined via:  RT, dilution curve
     - [X] Export abundance data as report & re-format slightly
     - [X] Data analysis in R
  
#### Record podcast pilot with Megan 
 - [ ] Read Megan’s paper
 - [ ] Rent mic from UW tech resources for this 
 - [ ] Where to record? 

#### Oly genetics hatchery vs. wild
 - [X] Meet with Brent re: Oly genetics paper, see if he has scripts for calling loci
 - [X] Gather materials from 1st genetic testing
 - [ ] Read Fischer et al. 2012

#### Application things
 - [ ] Start drafting GROW application
 - [ ] Get project description from Abigail
 - [ ] NDSEG
 - [ ] NSA travel grant, other?
 - [ ] Dive grant: http://www.wdhof.org/wdhof-scholarshipDesc.aspx
 - [ ] UW FINS for Vegas ?
 - [ ]  [Coenv travel fund, due Oct. 27](https://environment.uw.edu/students/student-resources/scholarships-funding/student-travel-meeting-fund/)
 
#### Oly experiment:
 - [X] Transition Oly's to ambient T
 - [X] Make screen envelopes and move olys to dock, affix to cage (move on Thursday 10/5). 
 - [ ] Set up Titrator!
 - [ ] Make sure I'm organized
 - [ ] Write-up 1-stop shopping list of Oly project including:
     - [ ] Experiment summary
     - [ ] Samples collected
     - [ ] Data collected
     - [ ] Treatments, populations, etc.
 - [ ] Figure out how/when to transport Oly samples from Manchester/Rick’s -80
 - [ ] Meet with STATS resource to figure out how to analyze Oly larval survival - parse out survival data to 224um, to juvenile, by time for reps
 
#### For Committee: 
 - [X] Schedule 1st meeting - mid October
 - [ ] Complete committee sheet for SAFS
 - [ ] Complete academic timeline 
 - [ ] Presentation for committee meeting: 20-30 mins, to include:
     * Overall goals of PhD
         * Research interests
         * Motivation
         * Post-graduation ideals
     * Proposed timeline, travel, etc.
     * What I’ve done to date
         * Chapter 1 - Proteomics
         * Chapter 2 - Oly OA/T experiment Generation 1
     * What I plan to do
         * Chapter X - Oly OA/T experiment Generation 2
         * Chapter X - Oly OA/T experiment, wild generation OR hatchery-produced F1’s (repeat experiment, using silos only for larvae!)
         * Chapter X - Oly genetics wild vs. hatchery (?)
         * Chapter X - Project in Australia on reproductive peptides
         * Chapter X - Could I do a geoduck genetics wild vs. hatchery? (or, what is “baseline”?)
     * Grants & Fellowships
     * Extra curriculars

#### Scientific Diving  
 - [ ] Find local vendor that sells dry suits, try on to determine size
 - [ ] Purchase gear 
 - [ ] Start weekly dives with Will beginning early-mid October
