### 6/16

- Counted rest of larvae from 6/15 screening
- Imaged all new larvae from 6/12, 6/14 & 6/15
- Prepared FSW+algae for larval experiment water change:
    - Filled Harvested 400mL Tiso & 400mL Chagra. I want 100k cells algae/mL in my larval experiment tripours, which are filled to 800mL. To determine algae concentration, I plunged and sampled 20ul and injected into hemocytometer.
    - Counted 5 of the 1mm^2 squares. Here are my calcs from the past few days:
    
### 6/17

Arrived, collected new larvae, of which there were lots:

Noticed that the algae dosing pump @ the small table (setting tank/K & HL broodstock) was not turned on. They were without food since X, so for ~X hrs.  I fed each setting silo 200mL of the algae cocktail in the algae header.

Prepared FSW+algae for larval experiment water change:

- I used a new water pre system, based on Katherineâ€™s protocol from last summer:
- Filled a bucket with 13L FSW (taken from my small table manifold, with the algae pump turned off).
- Harvested 400mL Tiso & 400mL Chagra. I want 100k cells algae/mL in my larval experiment tripours, which are filled to 800mL. To determine algae concentration, I plunged and sampled 20ul and injected into hemocytometer.
- Counted 5 of the 1mm^2 squares. Here are my calcs from the past few days:

- Mixed 630mL algae cocktail into 13L FSW, plunged, and filled 12 tripours to 800mL.
- Transferred larval silos into fresh water.

Larval bucket maintenance:
- Set up 2-bucket challenge by connecting the 100um and 180um within the SN & NF groups, and added a second bucket for the HL & K groups. This ends up taking ~1-1.5hrs; should determine how I can streamline this task.

Cleaned outside upwelling tank: turned of inflow, drained, filled with fresh water & added 400mL Vortex. Left pump on. Will leave it overnight to clean.

Gigas maintenance:

- Vacuumed as best I could. Noticed that there was lots of mucus in the east tank.
- Moved temperature probe & Durafet 3 into the east tank.
- Increased immersion heater set point to 20degC..
- Filled algae header with 485mL Reeds + fresh water.
