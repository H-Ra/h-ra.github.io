### Some documentation
  - A tentative [June/July coverage schedule](https://docs.google.com/a/uw.edu/document/d/1RJKuBeOHLGJozeUggr7xqP4xX6JHUg_xlOnxpMR1IcM/edit?usp=sharing)
  - And my my notes from the meeting with Alice last week, which will develop into a [Oly rearing protocol](https://docs.google.com/a/uw.edu/document/d/1GS7jVbvF-5JOP3fMc48Nwt8bDG9LX3ZAlv7VBbXQ5Iw/edit?usp=sharing): 


### Arrival inspection

Larval buckets:
  - Test bucket Check:
      - Not overflowing, despite not changing banjo yesterday.
      - T = 17.25 (T1)
      - pH = 7.88 (Durafet 2)
  - Aeration looks good
  - Algae concentration looks a bit weak - increased dosing rate from 60 -> 70
- New larvae in following catchment buckets:
    - K-10 Low - a bit
    - HL10 Low - a ton!
    - SN-6 Low B - a lot
    - SN-10 Low B- a lot
    - NF-6 Low B - a bit
    - NF-6 Amb A- a bit
- Maybe some in:
    - NF-10 Low B
    - NF-10 Low A
    - SN-6 Amb A
    - NF-10 Amb A
    - NF-6 Amb B

### Need to buy:
  - 15 feet 1/2 pvc flex hose (for freshwater flush)
  - 1/4” tube connectors - straight
  - 1/8” tube connectors- Y’s and straight

### Need to make:
  - Fresh water connection
  - Pipe with lots of holes for catch freshwater flush outflow
  - Microculch
  - Assemble setting tank silos

### Tasks Today
  - Collect new larvae, stock, sample excess - DONE 
      - This went smoothly, except that the banjo was left off group HL-10 low pH yesterday, so I therefore likely lost larvae. there still was quite a bit on the bottom of the bucket, but because of this likely fewer # of larvae in the bucket I added extra from today’s spawn.
  - Make freshwater connection - NOT COMPLETE, but I figured ou what I need to purchase
  - Clean top row broodstock & all components - DONE
  - Record location of top shelf broodstock on manifold - DONE
  - Change all banjos, drippers - DONE
  - Feed - DONE. used - 1/2 Ciso, 1/2 CGW
      - Increased algae capacity so I can take Sunday off:
          - 200L for larval tank 
          - 200L for other tank
          - 100L for gigas
  - Image plates - NOT DONE
  
  Discovered a flat tire on my bike, called an Uber- only $17, and he arrived within 15 minutes. Pretty sweet.
