### Lab Work

__Transferring Larvae Samples__

I continued to transfer the oyster larvae samples from Laura's project to 70% ethanol solution. I completed transferring the rest of the samples, which consist of numbers: 125, 153A, 28, 30, 33, 47, 35B, 70, 48, 23, 138B, 127, 94, 131A, 105A, 101, 112B, 147B, 71B, 20B, 145B, 4, 40B, 84, 10, 91, 110, 117B, 73B, 148B, 32, 103B, 93, 111B, 69, 68B, 51, 136A, 8, 1, 143A, 3, 62B, 72, 97, 132A, 128, 146B, 13, 18B, 5B, 90B, 98, 45, 17B, 78B, 151B, 75A, 106, 65B, 82, 116B, 92, 129, and 64.

Samples that were very soft include samples: 28, 30, 33, 47, 35B, 48, 23, 20B, 4, 40B, 32, 8, 3, 18B, 5B, 45, and 17B.

Samples that were somewhat soft include samples: 153A, 94, 145B, 10, 91, 110, 148B, 69, 68B, 51, 1, 97, 13, 78B, and 64.

### Next Steps

I will be working with Laura to learn more scientific and analytical skills using the O. angasi samples that she collected.
