### Podcast
Today Steven and I recorded a little bit of us talking about the spreadsheet and how I'll be doing the RNA isolating. What I am going to work on is an episode, or several short episodes, about the background of the project: bitter crab disease; Tanner crabs; Juneau, etc. I also am going to make a quick little intro that we can put at the beginning of all the episodes. I want to make one weekly, or at least release one weekly. And I would like to have some way to make it more easily understandable to people like my mom, or my friends. To do that I think I just have to make sure I explain what I'm talking about more. Obvoiusly I shouldn't be putting too much time into it because the main focus is on the research itself, but I'm excited and looking forward to learning more about this outreach tool and communication strategy.

### DIA Analysis
I looked at the DIA analysis of the 2015 oysterseed. I have no idea what I'm looking at anymore and am getting confused. I read a Skyline tutorial that Emma recommended I look at in order to learn more about how to tell if Skyline is picking peaks well ([tutorial](https://skyline.ms/_webdav/home/software/Skyline/%40files/tutorials/MS1Filtering-2_5.pdf)) but I am not fully grasping it. So, Emma is going to stop by on Monday to show me what's what!

### RNA Isolation
I am going to pick samples such that I'm following individuals throughout the entire project and within treatment groups. I'll begin next week and will keep track of what I'm doing. 

### Crab data sheet
I am re-organizing the crab data sheet that Pam sent me such that it will be machine readable for future analyses.
