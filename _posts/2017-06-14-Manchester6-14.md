title: Manchester, 6/13 & 6/14
---

### 6/13
  * Checked on upwelling tank temp, still holding at 17degC. 
  * Installed component on Calwell tank to make it into a gravity feeding tank
  * Temp in system still 16degC. Looks like the immersion heater I borrowed from Jon stopped heating, unsure why.  When I increased the set point the heater turned on.  Decided this heater needs a break; took it down, and replaced it with the new, spare immersion heater, and increased the set point to 20degC. 
  * Connected the 100um and 180um buckets together in preparation for Thursday's screening; 2-days for the larvae to complete the 2-bucket challenge. 
  * Reduced flow to the bottom row of the small table; broodstock buckets on the top a smidge lighter.  
  
### 6/14

* Arrival inspection:
  - All larval banjos **very** dirty. A couple buckets nearly overflowing. Changed banjos immediately.
* Screened and cleaned setting tanks and checked for set larvae:
  - Setters visibly inspected by first screening on to 450um, and viewing under microscope. Not very many, so I also sampled from the rest of the contents that did not hold on the 450um.  Saw some newly set oysters, as well as lots of larvae that had yet to go through metamorphosis. 
  - Cleaned setters/culch/larvae in freshwater bath
  - Oyster set observed in: 
    - NF-6 Ambient - lots of swimmers too
    - SN-10 Low - lots of swimmers
    - NF-10 Low - very few swimmers

    - NF-10 Ambient - very few swimmers, here's a photo of an oyster set:

    - HL-10 Ambient - a couple set
    - K-6 Low - no larvae visible in the sampled contents
    - K6 Ambient - just 1 setter, lots eyed larvae
    - K-10 Low - lots of morts, 1 larvae set visible 
    - Here's a video of the SN-10 Ambient group, in which I didn't see any set oysters, but there were lots of swimmers: https://youtu.be/SomPKWeWvfc
  - Not enough setters to warrant using the outside upwelling tank. Returned all larvae/set to the 180um silos in the downweling tanks.
* Collected new larvae:

* Changed filters
* Rinsed larval catchment buckets
* Increased Gigas temp to 18degC. Heater does not appear to be keeping up with the flow rate.  Will continue to increase temp by 1 degC/day, as to not shock them.
