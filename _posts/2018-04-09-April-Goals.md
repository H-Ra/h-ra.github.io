Things have gotten away from me the past few weeks due to my Manchester experiment & planning for AU. Here is my to-do list, hoping this will help me re-group: 

### Manchester project 
  - Finish building silos (ASAP)  
  - Consider imaging larvae for size comparisons (from count subsamples), or preserve some in ethanol for future ...  
  - Continue daily maintenance: daily counts, wter changes, finish stocking all silos, preserved for lipid analysis 
  - Compile expenses  
  - Follow up with dude from NSA conference re: lipid/glycogen assay  
  - Develop undergrad assistant schedule w/ Duncan, Heather  
  
### Geoduck paper
  - Email Micah re: exact dates probes were in water & geoduck were in water, chlorophyll data from summer 2017, more precise initial size values   
  - Address Emma's input  
  - Re-write discussion  
  - Re-analyze environmental data:  
      - As per Micah's responses to above questions (f needed)  
      - stat on daily mean and daily variance dataframes  
  - Send revision to Micah, Alex, Dave-o
  
### Australia 
  - Finalize experiment plan  
    - I've proposed several experiment ideas to Abigail & Wayne, and due to time/facility constraints and lots of overlap with Wayne's research/work already in progress, this is what we're landing on:  
      - Study the flat oyster, Ostrea angasi.  
      - Questions: 
        - How does O. angasi shift from nutrient storage (glycogen storage) to utilization for reproduction?  
        - Does insulin-like peptide expression correlate with gonad stage? (pending Abigail's input)  
        - For like-sex/stage animals, does provisioning differ by latitude? Does glycogen content vary by temperature?    
      - Sample oysters from several farms along New South Wales estuaries in which flats are currently cultivated. Oysters will all be from the same hatchery-produced "batch" (according to Wayne).  Measure glycogen/lipid content in gonad, and/or glycogen-synthase / glycogen-phosphorylase. Measure insulin-like peptide expression, if possible, as these are thought to regulate metabolism, growth, reproduction. Abigail is investigating this in other, non-molluscan species.  
    - Temperature and salinity sensors have been deployed at the NSW farms, and Wayne said that I will have access to at least 6 months of data for the northern- and southern-most estuaries (Camden Haven and Pambula).  
    - See if I can get chlorophyll data from satelite images along NSW coastline  
    - Figure out if I can do a short larval rearing experiment with brood collected from each farm - hypothesis is that warmer sites = less glycogen storage capabilities in gonad = less provisioned eggs = less larval viability.  
  - Submit visa app  
  - Purchase plane ticket  
  - Figure out car situation - purchase used? Lease?  

### Polydora paper
  - Incorporate feedback from Julieta, Heather  
  - Add final touches / missing info  
  - Invite input/co-authors: Steven, Brent, PCSGA rep, WDFW, hatchery rep (?), Betsy?  
  
### Admin 
  - Schedule committee meeting  
  - Compile list of things I'll need for the bypass option, plan my attack
