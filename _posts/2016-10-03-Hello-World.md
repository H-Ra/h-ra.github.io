## Hello!

My name is Yaamini Venkataraman, and I am a graduate student in the [Roberts Lab](https://github.com/RobertsLab) at the [University of Washington, Seattle's](http://www.washington.edu) [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](fish.uw.edu) (yes, that was a mouthful).

This website will detail my research. Soon I'll start a project examining the epigenetic response of ocean acidification on the Pacific oyster, _Crassostrea gigas_. Check back soon for updates!
