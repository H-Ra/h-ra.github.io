title: Pubathon - 14 Day Goals
---

I'm in the midst of my first Pub-a-thon, a Roberts Lab competition.  Thus far I've drafted methods & some background/intro language that I've pulled from my Oly proposal. Things have stagnated recently; it's time to get serious. Here are the 14-day goals:

#### [Geoduck Environmental Proteomics paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giP16iXWPE7oDSNI7fyLV3p_1jqsXuuxlH7cJQAwhLM/edit?usp=sharing)

  * Gather some missing info from Micah/Alex (e.g. environmental data)
  * Perform lit review on geoduck/clams, bivalve protein response to various environments
  * Outline geoduck-specific background section

#### [Ostrea lurida epigenetic inheritance paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQf4XiqQrEG0r3dHTzfgk2vP1jJ15giUT6SaqS0OTyc/edit?usp=sharing) - mostly a matter of gathering data & analyzing:

  * Mess with temperature data - synthesize into a plot
  * See if I can pull pH data from website, and/or if Doug can find the missing pH data
  * Identify best method for anayzing histology images
