I moved computers from Swan to Woodpecker. You need to File > Share > Complete. It becomes a .zip file. Upload to OWL. Open zip, and all the libraries and everything is included.

Swan will be used now for the Titrator TA.

I continued spot-checking the peaks. 

I am having a hard time thinking about whether I'm error-checking correctly. Currently, I am going through 100 peptides randomly. I am assigning a "1" to peptide peaks that were correctly chosen by Skyline. A "0" to ones where the wrong peak was selected.

Laura says she views this process as having four categories:
- There is a peak and Skyline chose the correct peak "1"
- There is a peak and Skylinie chose the wrong peak "0"
- There is not a peak and Skyline chose noise as a peak "0"
- There is not a peak and Skyline did not select anything "1"

The two "1" options are correct because Skyline did the right thing. I am wondering if there should be a way to distinguish between the two options - use letters? I may be making this all too complicated. Getting thoughts out now and will update notebook post according to what I end up doing.
