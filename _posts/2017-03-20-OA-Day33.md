title: Day 33 Activities report

#### Quick morning stop @ Manchester to tend the oysters. Here's the report.

##### Sampled for chemistry: 
  * Pulled water samples @ ~10:15am. Recorded grab sample T, pH, and S first
  * The salinity probe still wasn't reading salinity units; I used Rick's probe but also recorded our salinity probe's readings in micro-siebens/cm. Note: the glass bulb at the end of the probe appears loose, like it was cracked. I believe we need to purchase a new probe - it's ~$350. 
  * Added HgCl to each bottle
  * Recorded standard curve of TRIS
  * Cleaned filters. 1um looked pretty dirty (it had been very sunny), so I installed a new one. 
 
 That is all!
