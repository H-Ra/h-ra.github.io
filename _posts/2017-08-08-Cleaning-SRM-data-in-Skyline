Title: Cleaning SRM data in Skyline
---

### First steps 

  - Clean up data in Skyline: 
    * Use sequence file to associate .raw files with samples - determine which samples are which for the duplicate named files 
    * Make sure I have all data in Skyline 
    * Confirm correct peaks picked & determine if any transitions/peptides are un-usable
      - Need at least 2 transitions for each peptide 
    * Adjust peak boundaries
    Determine if any .raw files should be discarded 
    * Look @ all blank runs to see if there are any weird signals
    * Check out blank samples
  
    * Download data!
      - Protein, peptide, transition, area, retention time, 
  - Normalize area 
    * Select PRTC peptides that look consistent, elute @ 20-30 mins
    *
