I ordered two of the USB Samson Meteor Mic microphones.

The idea of having two is to allow for conversations between two people within the Podcast. I believe this can be easily done with GarageBand as you can assign the microphones to different voice track recordings. 

This week I will test out the RNA Isolation protocol with some extra crab Hemolymph. Not sure what day this will happen, but the process takes between 1.5 and 2.5 hours to complete, so I'll be sure to allow ample time for it.
