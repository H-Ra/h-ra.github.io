### Trust but verify, be explicit

Minimum maintenance days, but due to easy to make errors I've added 2 very useful mottos to my toolbelt: trust but verify, be explicit

#### 6/20
  * Ian connected 100um & 180um buckets to allow 2-days of flow-through
  * I collected new larvae; broodstock have definitely started to slow down, as only one group spawned today:

  * Changed water on growth experiment:

Mid-morning the hatchery lights were turned off for abalone spawn, and we hurried away for an overnight hike. After leaving the hatchery I realized that I had not **verified** that the connections Ian had made were done correctly, so asked Yaamini to check on my system to make sure nothing was overflowing. She did, and found that NF-10 Ambient larval bucket was overflowing. She turned off the water to let it drain into the 2nd bucket, then turned the water back on. 

### 6/21 

Arrived at the hatchery mid-afternoon. Unfortunately, the cause of the overflow in NF-10 Ambient was a kinked hose, which Y did not adjust, so the bucket overflowed all night/day until I found it this afternoon :( I should have been **explicit** in describing what to do if a bucket was overflowing. Because of this I likely lost most of my NF-10 Ambient 100um larvae. Need to compare #'s: stocking on 6/19 to remaining live/dead on 6/22 - see if I can parse out how many I lost. 

Additionally, Ian had overlooked one bucket group, **SN-6 Ambient**, not connecting for the 2 flow system. I did so this afternoon, which will allow less time for the live larvae to flow forward. Damn. Again, I should have verified.  **New Consideratoin: when trying to determine live/dead %, should remove the # iive larvae found in Morts bucket from stocking equation**

Good news is that I was able to get a change of scenery, hiking up to Silver Lake for the night
