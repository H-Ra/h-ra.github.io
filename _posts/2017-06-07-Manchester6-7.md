Today's activities
  * Cleaned SN & NF broodstock: soaked outflow tubes in vortex & cleaned, rinsed oyster with fresh water, cleaned buckets with vortex, moved broodstock around. Here's the configuration before cleaning today:

  * Added more outflow tubing
  * Chatted with Stuart regarding upwelling location and feeding regime. Here's the plan: use one upweller tank that is insulated, use an immersion heater to maintain temp, and feed using a gravity-fed Calwell tank.  
  
  * Drained the 180um buckets slightly (by lowering the T connection), and drilled a second hole in the back, and added an o-ring. Joined the 100um and 180um buckets, with the flow moving from 100um -> 180um, and a banjo only in the 180um bucket. Placed air stone in both. Will leave this set-up for 2 days, to allow all live larvae in the 100um to flow forward.  I had enough buckets to do this for all groups (SN, NF, HL & K). 

This is how I connected the buckets. ![img_9263](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17264765/27215368-a34bdda0-5225-11e7-9ddf-8cd8a962fe0a.JPG)  

  * Collected new larvae & stocked:
    * HL-6 Low  (first time this group has spawned)
    * K-6 Low
    * NF-10 Ambient A

The HL groups are noticeably active and jet black:
