---

#### After a couple months of school under my belt, here is a list of non-class related items I'd like to accomplish by December:

1. Determine if Winter 2017 oyster conditioning @ Manchester is feasible; _if yes:_ 
  * Finalize (at least) conditioning treatments and system modification needs  
  * Determine oyster broodstock source
  * Meet with statistics gurus to set boundaries on experimental design
2. Continue background research for oyster OA/T proposal, particularly epigen/transgen markers and methods 
  * Take Holly up on her offer to chat about this topic
3. Assist Rhonda with protein extractions to learn the ropes
4. Determine which DNR Geoduck samples to extract, and set dates for extractions (dependent on info from Micah and/or Alex)
5. Consider appying for Winter 2017 TA-ship(?) (depends on class schedule/potential Manchester work)
6. Solidify note-taking methodology in Evernote, particularly for academic lit. 
7. Register for Winter2017 classes
