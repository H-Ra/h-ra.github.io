title: December 3, 2019 - Transferring Frozen Larvae to Ethanol Part 2
---

### Lab Work

Today, I began transferring the frozen larvae samples into 70% ethanol solution and chose what samples to transfer via the randomized order noted in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VY8pYaiqphMSWbrDmwwtDvatZWmOWcfQH2bi3mHRK24/edit#gid=0).

I labeled the tubes in the order that I would be transferring the larvae from left-to-right and from top-to-bottom, as seen in the image below (the image's orientation should be rotated 90 degrees clockwise):

I followed the procedure for transferring ethanol from the Github issue shown [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/769). 

Today, I transferred 8 samples into ethanol: 141B, 99, 144B, 100B, 96B, 83B, 16B, and 134B.

One strange thing that I noticed was that sample 16B was very soft compared to the other samples.

### Next Steps

Continue transferring the frozen larvae samples into the ethanol solution
