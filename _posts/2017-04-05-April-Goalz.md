---

### Let's review March goals to see how I did:

#### Completed goals:
  * Solidify personnel schedule for OA experiment through March, particularly HgCl injections during NSA conference   
  * Formulate plan/timeline for post-OA conditioning, spawning, setting, and rearing Olyâ€™s. Need to do this ASAP!  
  * Poster - draft background/methods by 3/10, add data and have full draft by 3/17. Complete by 3/24, then attend conference!  
  * Draft & complete article for ComSciCon PNW, then attend  
  * Finalize proposal for Proposal Writing Class, study for Invert Zoology etc., also Qsci 482.  

#### Started, but not fully completed: 
  * Finish Pecan run! (ETA: Monday, March 6th)  
  * Figure out how to use Skyline  
  * Run files through Skyline, then figure out what to do next!  

#### Not Started: 
  * Research background/context for DNR paper; begin writing.  
  * Develop rough draft of Results section for DNR project  

### April Goals:  lots to accomplish this month! 
  * Proteomic project:
    * Meet with Proteomics project collaborators to discuss next steps 
    * De-multiplex .raw files 
    * Re-run Pecan on more powerful computer to generate full .blib file
    * Perform lit review, focus on geoduck/clams
    * Begin drafting background section
    * Develop rough draft of Geoduck Results section for DNR project  
  * Oly OA project:
    * Sample Oly's post-OA on April 8th - also hold the Ladies of the Lab night out 
    * Clean OA system
    * Condition Oly's, raising temperature 1degC/day to 18deg, hold there there until 4 days before PSRF needs to reduce to 14deg, then decrease 1degC/day to 14.
    * Inventory existing spawning & rearing materials to determine what's left to make/buy. Need: insulated 5 gal bucket, 2 gal bucket, mini banjos, air stones, blue lines, drippers (what rate?)
    * Figure out how/where to tap into heated line; can we tap in after the filtration system for PSRF's conicals? 
    * Send 4/8 histology casettes off for processing
    * Image histology slides
    * Process histology slide images with ... ImageJ(?)
    * Use histology images to inform tissue sample processing 
    * Research best method to use for DNA Methylation analysis; what other analyses should I consider? 
    * Finalize spawning/rearing plan 
    * Build system! - need to start week of 4/20
    * Augment Methods draft with Dec -> April activities
    * Get all water sampling & feeding data digitized
