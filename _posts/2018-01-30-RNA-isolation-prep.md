I will test out the [RNA isolation protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/rna_isolation_rnazol_rt.md) on some of the extra crab hemolymph samples we have stored in the -80. Since we are using hemolymph and not tissue, we will not need to use a mortar and pestle. Instead, I found this information regarding liquid samples:


"C. Liquid Samples. Homogenize/lyse liquid samples using 1 ml of RNAzol® RT per 0.4 ml of a liquid sample. For processing a small volume sample, mix the sample with 1 ml of RNAzol® RT and supplement the mixture with water to approach the sample + water volume of 0.4 ml."

This information was found [here](https://www.mrcgene.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RNAzolRTMarch2017.pdf) by looking at the mrcgene.com full protocol for RNAzol RT.
