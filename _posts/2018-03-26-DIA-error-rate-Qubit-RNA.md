### DIA error rate

I went through 100 randomly selected peptides to determine Skyline's error rate. 
I got an error rate of 35%, which means that for every 100 peptides, Skyline correctly selected:
- Likely a real peptide
- Peak boundaries ecompass the selected peak well
- Same peak at approximately the same retention time is selected for all repliates

I'm not exactly sure where to start going forward from this, but I'm happy to be done with the error rate portion (as long as I did it correctly)!
