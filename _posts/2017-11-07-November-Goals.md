### November tasks 

#### Geoduck proteomics
 * Data analysis continued
     - [ ] Finalize SRM tech. rep filter process
     - [ ] Generate Linear Response Plot, as per Emma:  Peak area on the y, amount of peptide (moles) on the x. Don't know absolute quantity of experimental peptides, could make the x-axis relative quantity or something. Can generate plots like these in MSstats.
     - [ ] DIA error rate  
 * Notebooks
     - [ ] DIA Skyline document, error rate checking
     - [ ] DIA analysis 
     - [ ] SRM dilution curve notebook
 * Researh 
     - [ ] Consider implications: HSP70 is not highly specific, since some interference w/ gigas in dilution curve
     - [ ] More lit review - bioassays
     - [ ]  Determine if abundance difference is “biologically relevant." If I can find SRM abundance good (haven't found good references yet), OR find citable % diff.
 * Writing Timeline:

|              | Analysis                                                                             | Writing                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Nov 1-5      | Additional SRM data analysis (follow-up to ANOSIM), dilution curve analysis notebook | More lit research & draft introduction       |
| Nov 6-12     | Re-do DIA analysis in R with notebook documentation                                  | SRM results DIA results                      |
| Nov 13-19    | DIA error rate, ROC curve, linear response plot                                      | Edits to introduction, and start Discussion  |
| Nov 20-26    | Refine protein box plots                                                             | More discussion                              |
| Nov 27-Dec 1 | Environmental data analysis & plots                                                  | Clean-up/edits                               | 

#### Oly genetics hatchery vs. wild
 - [ ] Read Fischer et al. 2012
 - [ ] Get most current data set from Crystal
 - [ ] ID best program to use

#### Application things
 - [ ] GROW 
 - [ ] Finish NDSEG
 - [ ] NSA travel grant, other? 
 - [ ] Dive grant: http://www.wdhof.org/wdhof-scholarshipDesc.aspx
 - [ ] NSA travel award
 - [ ] AA travel awards
 
#### Oly 2017 experiment:
 - [ ] Organize data
 - [ ] Analyze histology data
 - [ ] Determine which samples to sequence
 - [ ] Meet with STATS resource to figure out how to analyze Oly larval survival - parse out survival data to 224um, to juvenile, by time for reps
 
#### Oly 2018 experiment: 
 - [X] Help collect & clean FB 
 - [ ] Order histology supplies
 - [ ] Sample broodstock for histology, send off
 - [ ] Get broodstock into temp treatments

#### For Committee: 
 - [ ] Circulate proposal for approval
 - [ ] Submit paperwork to office & proposal online

#### Scientific Diving  
 - [ ] Find local vendor that sells dry suits, try on to determine size
 - [ ] Purchase gear 
 
 #### Record podcast pilot with Megan 
 - [ ] Read Megan’s paper
 - [ ] Rent mic from UW tech resources for this 
 - [ ] Where to record? 

### Misc.
- [ ] Learn how to tag notebook posts
- [ ] Throw away some geoduck vials (D, E, autosampler vials) & organize others (original samples, quantified proteins, digested peptides)
- [ ] Create README.md for proteomics data on Owl
