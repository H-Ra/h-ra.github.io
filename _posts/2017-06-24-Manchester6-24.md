#### New larval bucket protocol

After seeing high mortality in my 180um larvae this week I decided that I need to cull this group as well.  Up until this point I have always separated size classes for the SN & NF groups into two buckets, 100um and 180um, then connected them and allowed all live larvae in the 100um bucket to flow forward to "marry" with the 180um group. This protocol was developed as suggested by PSRF, as mortality rates in >180 tend to be much lower than 100um.  This, however, resulted in me never culling the 180um for NF & SN.  Today, I moved all the 180um larvae from the front bucket into the back bucket, as to allow all live larvae in both size classes to flow forward. This will be my protocol moving forward.  NOTE: this new protocol has been in place for the K & HL group already, since I didn't have enough materials to split size classes.  It's possible that the lower mortality in those groups are a result of this method.  While it's unfortunate that I cannot directly compare mortality rates between all 4 populations, I will be able to compare mort. rates between treatments within populations.
