## March Goals
- Isolate crab hemolymph RNA
- Weekly Podcasts
- DIA on 2015 Oysterseed experiment (make some headway on this)



### Looking back on February
- Test out the microphones that I rented from the Student Technology Loan Project (they are due back on Feb. 7)
- **We bought a microphone for the Podcast: USB Microphone Samson Meteor Mic**

- Test out the RNA Isolation protocol on some of the extra Tanner crab hemolymph samples
- **I tested out the protocol and got some RNA using the Qubit**
- Continue working on the 2015 *C. gigas* oysterseed DIA analysis
- **I made it to the part in the protocol where I have to do error-checking. Still have to do that**
- Read more papers on Tanner crab, *Hematodinium spp.*, gene expression, etc. I will be testing out how Mendeley will work for me in organizing the papers I read and for note-taking
- **I read a lot more papers with the help of assignments in my Proposal wriitng course (FISH 521) and my seminar class (FISH 514)**
