title: Lab day 5 - Evaporation
---

# Evaporating - that's it!

### Goal of the day was to bring sample volumes down to ~20ul. We anticipated that this would be a 10hr process, but turned out to take 14+hrs! Here's a timeline breakdown: 
  
  * 9:00 AM: tooks samples to genome sciences to use their regrigerated speed-vac; someone was using it @ a different temperature, so we waited. 
  * 12:30 PM: put samples on wet ice while we waited for speed vac
  * 2:00 PM: gained access to speed vac! Programmed it to: 4degC, no stop time

  * 10:00 PM: first sample (one of Yaamini's oyster samples) was ready for removal. Samples did not evaporate at a consistent rate. 
  * When removed from speed vac, samples were put directly on wet ice, and moved to the -80 in FTR within 30 minutes.
