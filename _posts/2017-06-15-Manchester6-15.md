Screening day. Some hiccups, but nothing devastating. Grace screening, Olivia working buckets/setup, me sampling/counting. Initial visual inspection of larval buckets look like larvae aren't doing as well as they were last week.  But, we'll see! 

Data:

Snafoo: the SN-10 Ambient group was mislabeled as SN-10 Low, and before realizing I stocked the 224um larvae (of which there were ~30k!) in the SN-10 Low setting tank. This error was caught moments later, and labeling/data entries were corrected.  Unfortunately, the SN-10 Low setting tank, which had been stocked with ~4,300 larvae since 6/5 and which I know there were still swimmers, is now mixed with ~30k SN-10 Ambient larvae. I started a new SN-10 Low setting silo. I kept the mixed up batch, labeled as such. Most of the animals in this group are from SN-10 Ambient.

TBD ..... more info...
