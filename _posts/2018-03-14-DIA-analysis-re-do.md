I re-did the DIA analysis from the beginning. This time I only used settings used by Emma in her Skyline document that she sent me. 

I think I must have done something better this time around, because a lot of the chromatograms are looking much better. Now I will do the error rate calculation and finally get into the data analysis after that.
