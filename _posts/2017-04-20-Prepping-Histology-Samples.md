title: preparing histology samples 
---

I prepped the histology samples taken on 4/8 and 4/13 to be sent off for slide preparation. My samples are Ostrea lurida whole visceral mass, with the goal of analyzing gonad maturation, and Yaamini's samples are exclusively Crassostrea gigas gonad. I sampled NF, SN & HL populations on 4/8 and K populations on 4/13.  Megan, Grace, Kaitlin, and Rhonda helped me by sampling the NF, SN & HL groups, and I did the K groups myself. 

**Sequence of events and sample handling**  
  * On 4/8 & 4/13: while sampling, once a cassette was full, it was immediately placed in the FIX solution. 
  * 24 hrs later the FIX was poured out of jars, and refilled with STABILIZER solution. 
  * On 4/20, to make sure we can read the correct orientation of the slides, I dotted the top left tissue in each cassette with blue ink. Here's my setup, and images of all the samples within each cassette for reference.
