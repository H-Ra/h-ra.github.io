#### Arrival Inspection

- Larval table, top row:
    - Lots of bubbles on side of buckets; after speaking with PSRF this is likely a sign of supersaturated water (N or O).
    - Color very light - it appears that I have the same un-even algae distribution problem on this table.
    - Air stones not bubbling enough- I opened their valves a bit more and that worked.  Seems like this is another depressurization issue. Not sure why.
    - Lots of larvae pooled on bottom of buckets- likely due to a combination of the above issues.

- Larval table, bottom row:
    - banjos very dirty, but not clogged
    - air stones working well
    - algae concentration appears appropriate
- Broodstock Table:
    - Things appear stable!
    - Very few bubbles on the sides of buckets
- Larvae present in:
    - SN-10 amb B
    - NF-6 amb A
    - SN-6 low A
    - SN-6 amb B
    - NF-10 low A
    - K-6 low
    - K-10 amb

#### Today’s Tasks:

- Moved all buckets that were on the top shelf of the larval table to the bottom shelf. Buckets that were on top shelf were: 11, 12, 13, 16.
    - Took photo of buckets 16 & 5 next to each other-obvious difference in algae concentration.

- Cleaned banjos in larvae
- Spoke with Ryan about June:
    - They do not know whether staff will be working weekends through June. If they don’t, then people w/o access cards/keys won’t have access to the lab. I asked whether, in that situation, PSRF would be able/willing to work my project on weekends. Ryan said maybe Jade or Stuart could- or perhaps one of them could run my project…
    - Ryan is going to talk to Stuart and consider whether Stuart or Jade could take the lead for my project while I’m at FHL.  Will get an answer tomorrow.
- Counted larvae collected yesterday
- Imaged larvae collected yesterday
- Collected new larvae, sampled, counted, stocked
    - Not too many larvae today. I’m streamlining this process, but currently takes a couple hours. Collection from today:

- Collected excess larvae in 2mL vials froze. Labeling scheme will be numerical:
    - Date, Oly, Vial # | e.g. "5/22/2017 Oly 1-A"
    - I had saved excess larvae from 5/20 & 5/21, so I sampled those and the excess from today:

- Determined how I should collect larval samples, and how frequently
    - I will collect larval samples daily when there are >10k excess larvae
    - Collection will occur after stocking buckets - I will save tripours with remaining larvae, then pull 2 samples each of 10k
- Figure out how to fix the over saturation situation
    - Ryan said I could install small degassing columns on each bucket, that the water would flow through prior to entering the bucket. Hmm….
- Figure out how to fix the algae concentration situation on the larval tank - not enough space to plumb algae input further back. Options could be:
    - Connect top and bottom manifold at other end to create a circular flow
    - Plumb in 2 pumps for each shelf

By the way, this is my banjo setup, which works very nicely in the quick-change:

#### To Do Tomorrow:

- Replace drippers
- Replace banjos
- Measure dripper rate @ larval tank
- Collect water sample for algae counts from each dripper - yikes!
- Record broodstock & larvae group locations on tables/manifolds
- Screen larvae for different size classes, count, re-stock buckets:
    - Screen through…. 140, 160, 180 … ?
    - Sample for counts & images
    - Sample for freezer
    - Stock buckets - method depends on # surviving larvae

#### To Do with time:

- Make connection for freshwater  - to do Thursday
