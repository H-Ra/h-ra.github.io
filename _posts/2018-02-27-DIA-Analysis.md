### DIA Analysis

Today I moved forward with the 2015 oysterseed DIA analysis. I followed the [DIA Analysis Protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DIA-data-Analyses.md) and for [Step 4f](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DIA-data-Analyses.md#step-4f-import-dia-data-into-skyline) I followed the instructions from Skyline's tutorial:

This allowed for the data to be combined in tabs per sample. There were four oysterseed samples, and four RAW files per sample. 


According to a GitHub issue [#186](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/186) question I had for Emma, I will continue with analyses, and after I select peptides to focus on, I will go back and check peaks and calculate error rate. 

### RNA Isolation 

Tomorrow I will isolate the RNA for the crab samples and will hopefully do it correctly. If it doesn't go well, the samples were done in triplicate, so I have a lot of extra tubes to work with if something goes wrong!
