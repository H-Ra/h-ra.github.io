title: Firing up the Mass Spec
---

Met Emma at the UWPR in South Lake Union; she brought our samples & the acetonitrile that we used for our samples.  
We transferred our samples into labeled autosampler vials. **NOTE: next time we need to bring empty autosampler vials for our blanks!!!**  

#### Notes from Emma's Lumos testing: 

Column packed to 30 cm and trap packed to ~3 cm with Dr. Maisch C18

Attach trap to mass spec with frit on mass spec side

test flow through trap - in BSM switch to trapping, set to 5% A, 0.2 flow
then up to 0.5, ~200 psm

attached 30 cm analytical column - analytical flow, 5% solvent B (ACN), flow at 0.2
Lost pressure at 3500 but can't see leak
switch back over to trapping, 5% A, 0.2 flow
See leak on trap input side; reattaching trap
run solvent through on trapping, 5% A, 0.2 flow
That seemed to hold, so changed flow to analytical, 0.2, 5% B, ~1300 psi
analytical flow (50% ACN, 0.2 flow) and let run 10 minutes, ~1300 psi

pressure crashed, I think it is the analytical column so I replaced with a new one
Equilibrated analytical column with 5% B, 0.2 ul/min flow
let run for 10 minutes once solvent droplet visible at column tip (~2700 psi)
switch to 5% A, 0.2 ul/min flow for 10 minutes (~2600 psi)
switch to 50/50, 0.2 ul/min flow for 10 minutes (~1200 psi)
up to 0.3 flow, ~3500 psi
cut analytical column to ~27 cm
switch back to 5% ACN for 10 minutes, 0.3 flow (~4200 psi but no leaks!)

Even with the high pressure at the 5% ACN, 0.3 flow rate I am going to see how the first QC injection goes - forgot to re-attach voltage until halfway through
