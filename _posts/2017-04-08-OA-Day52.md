title: Oly Sampling, post-OA
---

### April 8th, 2017: Lots of sampling today with help from the Ladies of the Roberts Lab: Megan, Rhonda, Grace, Kaitlyn, Yaamini, and myself (shoot, we forgot to take a photo). We also terminated the OA stage of this project. 

#### Collected water chemistry upon arrival.

#### Sampled animals from SN, NF & HL populations - all treatments and replicates. We shucked & pulled 5 tissues samples per animal: 
  * Flash-frozen in ethanol/dry ice bath, and stored in -80 in Rick's Lab: Mantle (M), Ctenidia (C), Adductor (A)
  * Excess tissue (any type) for DNA (E), stored in 1 mL ethanol and placed in fridge in rm 209 
  * Visceral Mass for Histology, oriented with right valve facing up, left valve facing down - the section will be taken from the left-valve side, which is the side not likely injured by the act of shucking.

#### Terminate CO2 injections
Kept all animals in existing setup, simply turned off CO2 injections via control panel, and disconnected CO2 line from header.
