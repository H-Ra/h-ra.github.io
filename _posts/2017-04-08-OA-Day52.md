### Lots of sampling today with help from the Ladies of the Roberts Lab: Megan, Rhonda, Grace, Kaitlyn, Yaamini, and myself (shoot, we forgot to take a photo). We also terminated the OA stage of this project. 

#### Animals sampling scheme today, 4/8/2017: 

|  Tissues sampled:                                                     |
|  Mantle (M), Ctenidia (C), Adductor (A),                              |
|  DNA in ethanol (E), Visceral Mass for Histology                      |
|----------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Tube Label           | Population | Treatment             | # Sampled |
| SN-6-16 to SN-6-24   | SN         | chilled T, low pH     | 9 (3/rep) |
| SN-6-26 to SN-6-33   | SN         | chilled T, ambient pH | 9 (3/rep) |
| SN-10-16 to SN-10-24 | SN         | ambient T, low pH     | 9 (3/rep) |
| SN-10-25 to SN-10-33 | SN         | ambient T, ambient pH | 9 (3/rep) |
| NF-6-16 to NF-6-24   | NF         | chilled T, low pH     | 9 (3/rep) |
| NF-6-25 to NF-6-33   | NF         | chilled T, ambient pH | 9 (3/rep) |
| NF-10-16 to NF-10-24 | NF         | ambient T, low pH     | 9 (3/rep) |
| NF-10-25 to NF-10-33 | NF         | ambient T, ambient pH | 9 (3/rep) |
| HL-6-10 to HL-6-15   | HL         | chilled T, low pH     | 6 (2/rep) |
| HL-6-16 to HL-6-21   | HL         | chilled T, ambient pH | 6 (2/rep) |
| HL-10-10 to HL-10-15 | HL         | ambient T, low pH     | 6 (2/rep) |
| HL-10-15 to HL-10-21 | HL         | ambient T, ambient pH | 6 (2/rep) |

Terminate CO2 injections (keep all animals in existing setup for a short time, simply drain/refill low pH header with ambient).
