title: Oly Sampling, post-OA
---

### April 8th, 2017: Lots of sampling today with help from the Ladies of the Roberts Lab: Megan, Rhonda, Grace, Kaitlyn, Yaamini, and myself (shoot, we forgot to take a photo). We also terminated the OA stage of this project. 

#### Collected water chemistry upon arrival.

#### Sampled animals from SN, NF & HL populations - all treatments and replicates. Here's the sampling scheme for today:

##### For all animals we shucked & pulled 5 tissues samples: Mantle (M), Ctenidia (C), Adductor (A), DNA in ethanol (E), Visceral Mass for Histology

#### Terminate CO2 injections
Kept all animals in existing setup, simply turned off CO2 injections via control panel, and disconnected CO2 line from header.
