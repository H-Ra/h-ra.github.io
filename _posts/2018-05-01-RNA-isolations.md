### RNA Isolations
_First set_   
Infected, ambient:

Qubit results:

**Tube 178 has a _really_ high number(26ÂµL in the Qubit sample!), so I am going to pick a new crab to replace it because that seems odd to me.**

_Second set_

**Note: I grabbed tube #37 instead of tube #73. Not a big deal because this tube luckily comes from a crab that survived the experiment (FRP: 6127) so if I need more uninfected ambient samples, I'll just do the second and third sampling day from that crab. Tomorrow I'll do the ACTUAL tube #73, along with a replacement set for the infected ambient crab that had an "out of range" result (Tube 141; FRP: 6183)**
