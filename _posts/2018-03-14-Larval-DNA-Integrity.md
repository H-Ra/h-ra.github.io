title: Assessing larval DNA integrity 
--- 

Today Sam walked me through the process of using [Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer kit](https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/G2938-90024_DNA7500-12000_KG.pdf) to assess DNA integrity (bp length) via fluorescence signal.  Unique aspect of using this kit/analyzer is that it only requires 1ul of sample, at DNA concentrations between 0.5-50 ng/ul. 

Steps: 
  * Sam removed kit reagents from fridge to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes 
  * Prepared new gel-dye mix as per kit instructions.  Prepared mix can be held at 4C for up to 4 weeks. All dye vials should be protected from light.  
  * Combined my sample reps into -A vial, e.g. transferred DNA from 1-B and 1-C to vial 1-A.  
  * Walked to Seeb lab in the 1st floor of the Marine Science building.  Materials I needed: DNA samples, new DNA chip, prepared gel-dye mix, DNA marker & ladder from kit, DI water (for chip wells without my samples), 10ul pipette, 10ul pipette tips.  
  * Followed kit instructions - loaded gel, marker, ladder, samples, and DI water onto chip.  Samples 1-8 were loaded into the wells of the same number.  Wels 9-12 were loaded with DI water. 
  * Turned computer on, started DNA 1200 series software. NOTE: computer has login password - make sure I have that for future uses.  
  * Inserted chip into analyzer, closed lid carefully.  
  * For Assay Selection file, selected dsDNA -> DNA 1200 series 11.xsy
  * For Destination file location, navigated to Roberts Lab folder  
  * Selected Start 
  
The software displays data in real-time with fluoresence on y-axis, and time on the x-axis.  Smaller DNA fragments "elute" faster, and likewise longer fragments take longer. Each sample well also has small (50bp) and large (17,000) standards/markers. We were hoping my DNA fragments would be long/as intact as possible. Here are some screen-shots of each fluoresence/time plot, along with the software's calculated bp/concentrations: 

### Screenshot of all plots; my samples are labeled Sample 1 through Sample 8. Samples 9-12 are just DI water. Samples 1-7 look somewhat consistent, but Sample 8 looks very weird. Note different y-axis range.
