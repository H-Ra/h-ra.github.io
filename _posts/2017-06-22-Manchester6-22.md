### Setters get bigger home, sampled SN growth trial, screened larvae

Lots to do today! 

#### First on the agenda, Grace imaged the screened larvae from 6/19 while Olivia & I set up a tank outside (adjacent to algae greenhouse) as a downweller to hold 180um silos. This is to make room for a new batch of setters inside so I mimimize risk should something go awry with a silo. Olivia then cleaned the 2 setting tanks inside to get ready for new 224 larvae. Details on the outside downwelling setup: 
  * Heated line @ 14degC flows into the small side (right side in image); 1 800watt immersion heater brings temp up to ~17-18degC. 
  * Water flows through 1/2" pipe into each silo through a small hole drilled directly into the pipe, fed via  gravity
  * Water is partially recirculated via a pump back into the small side of the tank to conserve heat and algae
  * Algae is dosed via gravity/dripper; directly behind this image is the greenhouse, where a Calwell tank is hooked up to a hose with a dripper, which drips into the small side of the tank.

 today.
 
#### Screened larval buckets
 
Monday was the first time I saw high mortality in a couple the 180um groups: SN-6 Low, SN-10 Low, NF-10 Low, and moderate mortality in SN-10 ambient. I saw similar high mortality in the 180um group today, again in the SN group - SN6 Low, SN10 Ambient, and SN10 Low (but notice that the SN6 ambient group looked good). NF10 Low also took a major hit today. Ciliates were visible under the dissecting scope in the SN6 Low, and in the NF10 Low.

#### Collected new larvae:

#### Sampled larvae from SN Growth Experiment

Today is day 7 of the growth trial, so I sampled larvae similar to the method Katherine used, with a minor adjustment. I sampleed ~40-50 live larvae from each silo in a consistently random manner. Protocol:
  * Lift silo out of tripour, pour some FSW from tripour into the lid of a petri dish
  * Place silo in the petri dish lid (it fits perfectly)
  * Using a head lamp and plastic pipette, randomly remove larvae from silo, moving into a well-plate. 
  * Count # larvae under dissecting scope. If more is needed, randomly sample more. 
  * When necessary remove water from well to make room for more larvae/water mixture 
  * All larvae were kept live in well plate, placed in fridge to chill/calm down so I could image them tomorrow.  
  * When finished sampling larvae from the silo, Grace gave them a 1min freshwater bath, then moved them in to their new FSW+algae mix and placed back on the table. 

##### Setup with silo in petri dish lid, pipette, counter and well plate at hand

##### Looking for larvae with a head lamp- they are small
