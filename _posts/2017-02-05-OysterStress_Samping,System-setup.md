[Full day of sampling!](https://youtu.be/y1bOt7gC9U4) THANK YOU to Megan Hintz, Olivia & Lindsay Alma for helping Yaamini and me with the sampling. Thanks to Steven for the oversight and OA system prep.

The 4 populations have been in 2 temperature treatments (6 deg, ~10deg) for two months, and are slotted to go into OA treatments Feb 8th, so Feb 4th was a big sampling day. 

Sampling scheme: all sampled animals were weighed (g), measured (mm), shucked, and tissue was extracted sparately:
  * Mantle (M), ctenidia (C) & adductor (A) were sampled into 2mL centrifuge snap-top tubes, immediately flash-frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath, and kept on dry ice until transported to the -80 in Rick's lab. 
  * The remaining visceral mass sampled for gonad was put into histology cassettes, ~4 per cassette. Viscerall mass was placed in cassettes with right valve side facing up. I noted which specimens looked ripe. Cassettes were labeled using both histology pen and notches (see labeleing map), and put into the fixative within ~45 minutes of sampling.
  * Any residual tissue (gill, mantle or adductor) was sampled for DNA by placing into tubes with 1mL ethanol, and stored at room temperature. 
 
Number of each population sampled; see [data sheet](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Stress/blob/master/Data/2017-02-04_SamplingData.xlsx) for details. 
  * Heare-2NF-6: 15 
  * Heare-2NF-10: 15
  * Heare-2SN-6: 15 
  * Heare-2SN-10: 15 
  * Heare-2HL-6: 9
  * Heare-2HL-10: 9
  
*None of Katherine's were sampled today, due to histology fixative limitations. 

Inventory of supplies needed for sampling:
  * scale 
  * calipers
  * Sharp shucker - need to purchase/bring
  * razor blade
  * fine-nosed scissors
  * Fine-nosed tweezers - need to purchase/bring
  * Medium weight boats for dissections
  * All-weather paper
  * Bleach for sterilizing
  * pre-labeled tubes, 4 per sample: Mantle, Ctenidia, Adductor, DNA tissue with 1ml ethanol
  * pre-labeled casettes - need to figure out which labeling pen works!
  * Ethanol
  * Dry ice - enough for 2 coolers (for smooth organization & transfer of samples to -80)
  * Glass container for dry ice bath
  * Tweezers and panty hose for snap freezing in dry ice bath
  * Tube racks
  * Data sheets
