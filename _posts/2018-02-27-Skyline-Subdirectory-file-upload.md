Today I figured out how to import Skyline DIA results (mzML or RAW) when there are multiple files per sample. Previously, I just uploaded all files, and I ended up having 16 tabs in Skyline. Now, I have 4 tabs (4 samples) and each tab has the four files within it.

I am following the [DIA analysis protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/DIA-data-Analyses.md).

At Step 4f, where I upload the RAW data files, I followed the instructions directly from the [Skyline tutorial slides](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-pacific.oyster-larvae/blob/master/Skyline-example-files-ETS.sky/slides01.pdf) so that I could combine the data files that were for one oysterseed sample. That way, I only have four tabs, rather than 16 tabs to deal with, because each sample has 4 data files associated with it. Here is what I did:
