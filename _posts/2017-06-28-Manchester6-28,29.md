### 6/28 Low impact day
  * No new larvae, but NF6 Low A was "spawny"
  * Water change on growth exp

  * Swapped in clean banjos
  * Imaged plates #1-4 from 6/26
  
### 6/29 - high impact day- screened larvae & collected new; sampled growth exp; water change, rinsed downwellers

#### New larvae

#### SN Growth exp. water change
Today the algae was not very dense, so the algae volume added to 18L was substantial (1.7L), so to bring the concentration up to ~100k cells/mL I added 1900 mL of the cocktail.

#### Cleaned all downwellers
BTW, Yaamini jumpied in today to help a TON since Olivia was sick, which included rinsing my downwellers with fresh water.  Thanks Yaamini! 

#### SN 14-day sampling
I sampled larvae from the growth experiment again today, as it's day 14.  Ran into some high mortality in a few silos, and as I would like to keep the experiment going through metamorphosis I decided to only sample 30 from each silo (except for one, which had very hig mortality). A few notes:
  * High mortality in:
    - SN10 Ambient, B
    - SN10 Ambient, C
    - SN6 Ambient, E - only found 4 live. I sampled these for growth, and terminated this silo in the experiment.
  * In the beginning of the sampling I removed all the live larvae from SN10 Ambient B, then tossed the dead. I decided not to do this for all the other silos. Need to remember this when assessing set larvae. 
  * SN10 Low: I accidentally put some of rep C into B (~8 or 9 larvae); I thus only stocked 22 larvae in rep C, and there's ~39 in rep B.
  * I've decided to keep this experiment going as long as I still have live animals. So, I sprinkled 224 microculch into each silo, and will continue to change water. However, since I am not down to ~400 larvae in each silo so .5 larvae/mL, and the rule is 1 water change/day for 1 larvae/mL, I can get away with a water change very **other** day.

#### ACH! Not Again!
I did a final check before leaving, and saw some water dripping off the table. **There should be no water.** Found that the back "hole" crimper had popped open at some point in the past few hours in the **HL6 Ambient** bucket, losing some larvae, how many I do not know :( I will compare stocking #'s from today with Monday's, but I did see lots of larvae still present, which is good!
