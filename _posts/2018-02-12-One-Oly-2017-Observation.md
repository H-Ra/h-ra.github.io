title: An Observation, 2017 Oly Data
---

Looking at the Oly data from the 2017 Oly project, I see a couple patterns. Check out the below image, where I simply identify the treatment within each population that had the **MOST** and **LEAST** of the following:  
  1. Gonad ripeness post-OA  
  2. Larval production  
  3. % larval survival  

The coding as as follows:  
  - 6L: 6degC, low pH  
  - 6A: 6degC, ambient pH  
  - 10L: 10degC, low pH  
  - 10L: 10degC, ambient pH  

My observations:  
  1. The group that spawned the most number of larvae (normalized per oyster) consistently had the poorest larval survival across all populations.      
  2. The South Sound F1 and F2 groups have identical patterns, indicating a genetic component in how the environment impacted phenotype.  
  3. Some similar patterns between Hood Canal and Fidalgo Bay, but less so than the SS F1 and F2
