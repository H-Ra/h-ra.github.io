title: December Goals (belated)
---

### Time flies, especially when I get various waves of data that needs analyzing, and also Thanksgiving, tests/papers from class, etc... Lots of tasks will carry over from November, BUT nevertheless, headway has been made. 

### Olys at dock
  * Clean, measure broodstock (after hatchery meeting)

#### Geoduck proteomics
  * Finish Results section  
    - Correlation btwn various parameters, protein abundance 
    - Try to use Structural Equation Model instead of linear regression model 
    -  QA %>1SD & %>2SD calculations
  * Get more methods info from Micah, Emma  
  * Focus on DISCUSSION  
  * Identify target journals  
  * Determine figures for paper. Candidates:  
    - Box/violin plots of protein abundances by subbasin, including 3 peptides separately. Like this, but with 4 panes for each protein:
    ![img_3305](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17264765/33912883-6567cb02-df4c-11e7-838e-371de3fd2018.JPG)  
    - NMDS plot (like what I already have) with overlaying circles by subbasin  
    - 3-pane plot of pH, T, and DO (continuous)? Would be messy with all 8 traces from each site.  
    - Correlation matrices for: variables identified in model (DO var, pH >1sd %, and growth)  
  * Remaining things that Emma said I should do:  
     - Linear Response Plot, as per Emma:  Peak area on the y, amount of peptide (moles) on the x. Don't know absolute quantity of experimental peptides, could make the x-axis relative quantity or something. Can generate plots like these in MSstats.  
     - DIA error rate   
     - SRM dilution curve  
 * Idea for paper, but would take a while (probably a few days): screen all proteins in DIA Skyline data for a "menu" of targetable, detectable proteins (based on visual check of chromatograms).  This could be published alongside the paper as a very usable resource.  
 * More lit Research   
     - Growth related to protein expression - but why only some proteins were diff. expressed?    
     - Bioassays  
     - Determine if abundance difference is â€œbiologically relevant." If I can find SRM abundance good (haven't found good references yet), OR find citable % diff.  
 
#### Prep for Oly genetics hatchery vs. wild analysis
 - re-Read Fischer et al. 2012
 - Get most current data set from Crystal
 - ID best program to use

#### Application things
 - Finish NDSEG, get letters  
 - AA travel awards (?)  
 
### Misc.
- Submit MS paperwork to office & proposal online (pending approval from Rick, Jackie)
- Learn how to tag notebook posts
- Create README.md for proteomics data on Owl

### In January:
 - Determine which Oly samples to sequence from last spring/winter
 - Meet with STATS resource to figure out how to analyze Oly larval survival - parse out survival data to 224um, to juvenile, by time for reps

### On hold: 
 * Record podcast pilot with Megan
 * Find local vendor that sells dry suits, try on to determine size, then purchase gear 

### Accomplishments from last month
  * Checked out [Oly histology data](https://github.com/laurahspencer/LabNotebook/blob/master/_posts/2017-11-07-Oly-Histology-Pie-Charts.md) from last year's experiment  
  * Cireculated MS proposal for approval from committee  
  * Submitted NSA abstracts, travel grant app  
  * Sampled experimental Olys for histology (time=0), got animals into treatments  
  * Received collection permit @ Mud Bay, made contact with homeowners for access, collected first batch  
  * Gave Oly shells to Heater @ Wood's lab for Polydora inspection  
  * Got the CoEnv travel grant for AA  
  * Proteomics stuff:   
      * Finalized SRM tech. rep filtering process
      * Tracked down tidal charts from each Geoduck Proteomics ouplant location; used to process/filter environmental data from Micah  
      * Generated summary statstics on environmental data  
      * Re-ran proteomics analyses on the peptide-level, where transitions within each peptide were summed. Lambda-transformed peptide   abundance for normal distribution, then ran 2-way ANOVAs.  
      * Learned how to run stepwise linear resgression models, ran on diff. expressed proteins with environmental summary stats.  
      * Refined methods section of paper   
      * Made headway on results section of paper   
      * Drafted intro; will likely need to revise based on results  
      * Finished parasite class things  
      * Generated notebook for DIA data in Skyline  
      * R-script for merging DIA results with annotations, extracting SRM targets from this dataframe  
      * Generated peptide variability stats for paper  
      * Discarded unecessary vials (the "just in case" vials, and autosampler vials prepped for mass spec). If I need to re-run samples, I'd prepare new autosamper vials from my digested peptides.
