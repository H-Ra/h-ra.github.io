Title: Pecan!
---

## Pecan! Lesson of the month: Proteomics bioinformatics is very intense. 

As mentioned earlier today, Pecan has been running for ~2 weeks on Emu, and it looks like it will take another 7-10 days longer (here's hoping!), given the current rate.  To catch everyone/myself up on the bioinformatics steps taken to start my Pecan run, I've retrieved and posted my Jupyter notebooks and posted them to a new GitHub repository:

  * My new [Geoduck Proteomics repo](https://github.com/laurahspencer/DNR_Geoduck)  
  * Jupyter Notebooks:  
    * [_In silico_ digest](https://github.com/laurahspencer/Geoduck-DNR/blob/master/Documentation/Using%20Protein%20Digestion%20Simulator%20on%20Emu.ipynb) of a background proteome using ProteinDigestionSimulator  
    * [General file prep for Pecan](https://github.com/laurahspencer/Geoduck-DNR/blob/master/Documentation/Preparing-files-for-Pecan.ipynb)  
    * [Executing Pecan](https://github.com/laurahspencer/Geoduck-DNR/blob/master/Documentation/Running%20Pecan.ipynb)
