### Lab Work

__O. angasi Papers__

Today, Laura gave me a quick runthrough of her project and few papers to read in order to prepare for the histology analysis that I will be doing on the O. angasi samples that she collected from Australia. Below are some general key points that I gathered from these papers on how to determine oyster gonad sex and stage (links to the papers are highlighted in blue): 

1. [Differences in gametogenic cycle among strains of the European flat oyster Ostreaedulis and relationship between gametogenesis and bonamiosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848608008156)
	1. Gonad Sex
		* this section was broken down into 6 categories:
			1. Indeterminate (I) - only collaped/empty follicles
			2. Male solely (M) - only male gonad material in follicle
			3. Female solely (F) - only female gonad material in follicle
			4. Hermaphrodite with both sexes equally represented (HBS) - half female and half male gonad material in follicle
			5. Hermaphrodite predominantly male (HPM) - mostly male gonad material in follicle, but some female gonad material also present
			6. Hermaphrodite predominantly female (HPF) - mostly female gonad material in follicle, but some male gonad material also present
	2. Gonad Stage
		* This category was broken down into 6 stages:
			1. Inactive or resting gonad 
			2. Early gametogenesis 
			3. Advanced gametogenesis
			4. Ripe gonad
			5. Partially spawned gonad
			6. Reabsorbing gonad
2. [OBERVATIONS OF GONAD STRUCTURE AND GAMETOGENIC TIMING IN ARECOVERING POPULATION OF OSTREA LURIDA (CARPENTER 1864)](https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/13329)
	1. Gonad Sex
		* The gonad sex determination in this paper is the same as the paper above
	2. Gonad Stage
		* The gonad stage determination in this paper is similar to the paper above
3. [Factors effecting reproduction and larval development ofOstrea angasi (Sowerby 1871): Advancing hatcheryproduction](https://eprints.utas.edu.au/23098/1/OConnor_whole_thesis.pdf)
	1. Gonad Sex
		* gonad sex was broken down into 6 categories, with 2 subcategories for spent/spawning males and females:
			1. spent/spawning males
				* developing male - spermatogonium, spermatocyte balls, and a few spermatozoa balls present
				* ripe male - mostly spermatozoa balls present, few spermatocyte balls, and no spermatogonium
			2. spent/spawning female
				* developing female - oogonia and developing oocytes present; no free oogonia
				* ripe female - free oogonia present
			3. predominantly male (mostly sperm present)
			4. predominantly female (mostly oocyte present)
			5. non-defined
				
	2. Gonad stage
		* This paper did not provide information on how they determined gonad stage
4. [Gametogenesis, sex ratio and energy metabolism in Ostrea angasi: implicationsfor the reproductive strategy of spermcasting marine bivalves](https://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/84/1/38/4626750)
	1. Gonad Sex
		* The sex determination was simply divided into four categories: male, female, hermaphrodite, and undifferentiated. Oysters containing larvae were automatically categorized as female unless they also contained spermatozeugmata. 
	2. Gonad Stage
		* The gonad stage was broken down into 5 categories: 
			1. resting gonad
			2. early gametogenesis
			3. advanced gametogenesis
			4. mature gonad
			5. spawned gonad
		* descriptions of the stages are not provided in the text, but images associated to each of the stages are

### Next Steps

1. Continue to read papers given by Laura more in-depth
2. Begin to look at images and practice determining oyster gonad sex and stage of development with Laura
