### O. angasi Background Research

Today, I continued to look through background research on O. angasi. I found a ["National Review of *Ostrea angasi* aquaculture"](http://www.imas.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/936536/160181-UTAS-Scientific-Report_-Angasi-aquaculture.pdf) that proved to be very useful in terms of finding information on the life history and general history of these oysters:

* General History: 
	* O. angasi are oysters native to southern Australia 
	* Due to overharvesting, O. angasi population was greatly reduced from original size
	* The Nature Conservancy is trying to help in the recovery of this species and the reefs that are created by them
	*  Shellfish reefs provide ecological and economic benefits to their marine environment
* Life History:
	* Hermaphroditic
	* Differ from Pacific oyster because:
		* they produce fewer eggs
		* eggs are kept in the female's mantle cavity instead of being ejected out
	* Since oyster larvae are kept in female's mantle cavity for a certain period of time, larvae survival rates tend to be higher in flat oysters than Pacific oysters
	* Similar to Pacific oyster, larvae go under metamorphosis to become an oyster

### Next Steps

1. Start doing PCR and gel analysis with new primers next week
2. Start transferring Olympia Oyster larvae into ethanol starting next week
