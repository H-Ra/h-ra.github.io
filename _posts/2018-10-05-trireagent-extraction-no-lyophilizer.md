Today I am extracting RNA from four practice samples using Tri-reagent, and without lyophilizing (lyophilizer is out of commission again for now). 



# Protocol (from Tri-reagent protocol in [Sam's notebook](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2018/09/17/3558/))

1. Added 1mL TriReagent to each tube
2. vortexed to mix/dissolve solute
3. incubated 5mins at RT
4. added 200uL of chloroform, vortexed 15s to mix
5. incubated at RT for 5mins
6. centrifuged 15mins, 12,000g, 4ËšC
7. transferred aqueous phase to new tube
8. added 500uL isopropanol to aqueous phase
9. mixed, incubated at RT for 10mins
10. centrifuged 8mins, 12,000g, at RT
11. discarded supernatant
12. added 1mL 75% ethanol
13. centrifuged 5mins, 12,000g at RT
14. discarded supernatant
15. resuspended in 10uL of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O.
