### Larvae! 

The K-10 low pH and K-10 amb pH populations spit out larvae today.  Here's how I know - you can see the larvae collecting against the banjo @ water level in this **K-10-amb pH group**:

And in the water by shining a flashlight against the bucket:

And in the **K-10-low pH group**:

I collected the larvae using a 100um screen, with a 200um screen on top to filter out some of the debris. I then poured into a tri-pour, filling to 300 mL:

Using a plunger to thoroughly mix the larvae in the 300 mL, I pulled 3 x 500uL count samples into a well plate, and after checking out the larvae under the scope for a minute...

I added 1 drop of Lugols to each for counting purposes (this kills the larvae, and makes counting very easy):

Today's tasks:
  * Installed immersion heater in header tank, and set temperature to 18degC. The temperatures in all tanks had increased to ~19.5degC over the past couple days, so to test the heater's abilities I opened several valves full-blast and added only ambient (~11degc) water. After I had brought the temp down to ~16.5degC, I set the mixing valve temp to 14degC. Here's how things look after a few hours:

  * Installed in-line cartridge filters (20um, 5um, 1um)

PSRF moved from Reeds Shellfish Diet to a live algae cocktail yesterday (5/10)
