## The finale: a day of desalting

Our last day in the lab was spent desalting our samples. This involved preparing columns, and washing a series of solvents through the columns to remove salts and retain the peptides. As usual, we followed the [protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/ProteinprepforMSMS.md) listed on LabDocs repo, with very few tweaks. Here's what happened: 

Reagents required: _Luck us, Rhonda prepared plenty Solvent A, B, & Final for us to use. They are OK to be stored on the lab bench._  
  * Solvent A = 60% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (300ul/sample)  
  * Solvent B = 5% acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (500ul/sample)  
  * Final Solvent = 3% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid (100ul/sample)  
Other supplies needed:  
  * Macrospin columns; 2 columns per sample  
  * Centrifuge tubes; 2 tubes per sample  

**Procedure:**
  * **Step 1:** Grabbed "G#-D" samples out of freezer, allowed to thaw. 
  
  * **Step 2:** Labeled 2 sets of macrospin columns and 2 sets of centrifuge tubes:
    * Macrospin columns & collection tubes for collection solvent and salts, to be discarded @ end of day: G#-E 
    * Macrospin columns & collection tubes for final peptide collection: G#-F
    * Centrifuge columns & collection tubes for "just in case" Solvent-A collection: G#-E-1
    * Centrifuge tubes for "just in case" Solvent-B collection: G#-E-2
    
  * **Step 3:** Reconstituted samples in **100 µl solvent B**. Need sample solution =< pH2. If too basic, added 10-20 µl increments of 10% formic acid and tested by applying 2ul sample to pH test strip); I began by testing one sample, but got worried that I was taking too much out of it, so moved on to test three other samples. In the end, I added 170 ul to each sample and confirmed pH<2 for all samples.

  * **Step 4:** Washed column: **Added 200 µl solvent A to columns**, spun for **3 mins @ 2000 rpm**, repeating 3 times for a total of 4 times. Discarded remaining liquid everyother time to accomodate room for next round.

  * **Step 5:** Equilibrated column: **Added 200 µl solvent B to columns**, spun for **3 mins @ 2000 rpm**, repeating 2 times for a total of 3 times. Discarded remaining liquid everyother time to accomodate room for next round.

  * **Step 6:** Loaded protein on column: **Added all digested sample to columns** (30 ug protein in 100 uL). Spun for **3 mins @ 3000 rpm**. Collected flow-through, put back on column and spun again. Peptides are now in the columns. Transferred the remaining liquid to new tubes labeled G#-E-1 (just in case) and store at -80C.

  * **Step 7:** Wash salts through column: Wash columns with 200 µl solvent B, spinning at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes, repeating twice for a total of 3 times. Saved remaining liquid at the bottom of each tube by transferring it to a new tubes labeled G#-E-2 (just in case) and stored at -80C

  * **Step 8:** Eluted peptides: Transferred columns to clean collection tubes labeled G#-F . **Added 100 µl solvent A**, spun for 3 mins @ 3000 rpm, repeating once for a total of 2 times. **Good warning: The peptides are now in the liquid- do not discard!**

  * **Step 9:** Took samples on wet ice to Genome Sciences to use speed-vac. Evaporated samples to near dryness at 8C in speed vac. 

  * **Step 10:** Reconstitute peptides in 100 µl final solvent. Light vortex and centrifuge down. Store at -80°C.
