title: Cleaning day - rinsing Olys and cleaning OA system
---

It's been 1 week since I moved my Oly seed to the dock; today I checked on them to ensure the screen envelopes are still secured and to rinse them with fresh water.  Everything was still in place and the screen wasn't too dirty, so I'll wait ~10 days to 2 weeks to return.  I also tagged the Oly cages 92. NOTE: there are three cages hanging together on 92; my Oly broodstock and some of Yaamini's gigas are in 2 cages, and my Oly seed are in the other.
