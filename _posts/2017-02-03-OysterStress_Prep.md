title: O. lurida Climate Stressor project well underway! 
---

We went out to Manchester on 1/25/2017 to check on the Olympia oysters that are already (!) undergoing temperature treatment, to assess the OA system.

Things we did:
  * Rinsed oysters with fresh water & counted 
  * Filled header tanks to the brim with fresh water, dosed with 12.5% bleach (~0.5 ml / L) 
  * Tested Durafets in the same filtered seawater, to see how they are doing. One (the "green" one) was reading erratically.
  
### Here is a survey of the animals, which have been in 2 temperature treatments since December 6th.  

#### Katherine's Oysters: (split into 2 bags per treatment)  
  * Katherine-SS-F2-2015-Amb: 170 live, 167 live  
  * Katherine-SS-F2-2015-8: 168 live, 148 live  
  * Grandparents (F0) are wild broodstock collected at [WHERE?] in [WHEN?], then spawned in Port Gamble hatchery.  
  * Parents (F1) hatched at Port Gamble, ouplanted for [X months] in [Where?]  
  * These (F2) hatched in 2015 and grown 100% in Clam Bay  
#### Jake's Oysters: (split into 2 bags per treatment; 0 dead unless noted)  
  * Heare2SN2014-Amb: 51 live, 48 live  
  * Heare2SN2014-8: 52 live, 50 live  
  * Heare2NF2014-Amb: 51 live, 47 live & 1 dead  
  * Heare2NF2014-8: 46 live, 53 live  
  * Heare2HL2014-Amb: 29 live, 27 live  
  * Heare2HL2014-8: 28 live, 27 live  

### Things to do and decisions to make:  
  * Temperature related:  
    * Need to slowly increase temperature on chilled oysters before plunging them into ambient. Increase temp 1 degree on Saturday 2/4  
  * What temperature to use during OA?  
    * Ambient (currently 10), which warms up a couple degrees, likely getting up to 12degC.  
  * Ordering needs:  
    * Filter cartidges from Harrington Plastics:  
      * 1 micron 20" WB-20-1W  
      * 5 micron 20" WB-20-5W  
      * 20 micron 20" WB-20-20W   
    * Reeds algae past - 1 quart shellfish diet  
    * Tubing for algae dosing pumps  
    * Flow meters, King acrylic   
  * Attach water pumps  
  * Set up algae dosing pumps  
  * Plumb at least one more valve   
  * Test the mixing valve; weâ€™ll need to slowly increase temperature in all tanks for spawning, so best to test that now  
  * I expect we will not aerate the tanks, as this would likely mess up the chemistry. But, will the animas be okay w/o aeration; will high flow rate suffice?
  
  Proposed OA Maintenance: 
  
### OA System Needs, during trial:  
  * Clean oysters & tanks 1x/week - LHS/YV
  * Feed daily & clean algae header tank as needed - PSRF
  * Spray down sock filters, every other day-ish - PSRF
  * Replace filters, 1x/week - LHS/YV
  * Keep record of weird occurrences - PSRF & LHS/YV
  * Take water chemistry samples 2x/week - PSRF & LHS/YV (split once a week per)
    * 1L grab samples, measure T, S & pH (mV) with handheld probes
    * Discrete water samples dosed with HgCl, 2 per treatment & culture tank (12 total)
