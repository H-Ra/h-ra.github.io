title: Manchester, 7/5 & 7/6

We are now running like a well oiled machine, employing _progessive assembly_ practices. 

#### Anyone want to check out my spawning data to date?

### 7/6 High impact day.  The dream team did a fantastic job today, finishing tasks in RECORD TIME. 

#### Screened larvae
data TBD (once digitized)

#### Olivia TCB'd it
  * Vacuumed gigas
  * Rinsed all downwellers, outside and inside, with fresh water
  * Cleaned broodstock, did not re-configure

#### Flush larval table with fresh water
Hooked up fresh water line to the large, center table that houses the larvae and SN/NF broodstock. Over the course of ~1 hr, I ran fresh water through every valve for ~10 minutes per valve.

#### Checked out SN & NF setters in the outside tank
It is not feasible to quantify # of live setters at this point, but here is some qualitative info:
  * SN10 Low      No visible live at any stage :(
  * SN10 Ambient  No visible live at any stage :(
  * Mixed SN10    A couple, but compared to the # stocked (~35K), very, very few
  * SN6 Low       A few
  * SN6 Ambient   A couple
  * NF6 Low       A couple
  * NF6 Ambient   Quite a few!
  * NF10 Low      A few
  * NF10 Ambient  Quite a few!

#### New larvae 
I surreptitiously stocked 200k larvae from the SN10 Ambient group, since that larval bucket was all but empty, and I saw very, very few (possibly no) larvae that had survived through to setting.
