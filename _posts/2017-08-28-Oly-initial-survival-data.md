title: Initial survival data, Olympia oyster experiment 2017
---

The following is data on Oly survival from larvae to juvenile. Data is adjusted for a few events where larvae were lost due to overflowed bucket, etc. Data was adjusted by calculating the mean % larvae accounted for from one bucket count to the next (pretty good, 94%), then taking the difference between the actual # counted during screening after loss event and what would be predicted by the 94% accountability rate. 

Charts include survival % within each population, as well as the total number of larvae stocked in culture buckets, for reference. NOTE: larval buckets were not stocked over 200,000 larvae per bucket. 

Note: Hood Canal juveniles have yet to be counted, since they are too small, and therefore are not included in these charts.
