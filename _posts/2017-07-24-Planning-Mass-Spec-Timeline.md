#### How many samples can I run?
@ 8:30am on Monday 7/24 I got my samples started again.  I need to figure out how many more samples I can run within the given timeline. Here are the considerations: 
  * Running samples in batches of (5 samples) + (1 QC) + (1 blank) = 500 minutes total, so that's 100 minutes / sample.
  * We have until 10am on Friday 7/28 
  * Need 40 hrs for the dilution curve run 
  * So, need to be done with my samples by Wednesday 7/26 @ 6:00pm
  * Time between this morning @ 8:30am when I re-started my samples & 7/26 @ 6pm = 57.5 hrs = 3450 minutes / 100 minutes/sample = 34.5 samples. 
  * I have 25 samples left to run, plus 2 blanks (Gblank & OBlank) which I could run twice.  
  * Should be done with my samples on Wednesday @ 5:30am, this includes 1 run of each blank. 
  
#### Thoughts on whether or not to re-make samples 
Up to this point I have 20 samples where a handful of peptides don't show up from both PRTC and my samples.  In PRTC there are 4/9 poor quality peptides, and in my samples 3/39 poor quality transitions.  In an ideal world I would remake these ~20 samples, run the new batch twice while being careful with freeze/thaw and time out of the freezer. However, I don't have time for 2 runs of remade samples. I could remake, then do 1 run of each in the hopes of capturing data on those 3 transitions.  However, I think it's best to have replicates of the 36 good quality transitions in my samples. Also, the 3 poor quality transitions were not in the sample proteins, so I can likely draw conclusions about protein quantification from the other 2 transitions.  The differing rates of peptide degradation between samples does make me a little concerned; I'm wondering how folks take this into consideration.
