Today I chose some crab samples for RNA extraction. [I made a chart](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/Crab-samples-for-RNA-extraction.png) with the tube numbers for the samples. I picked tube numbers that belonged to the same crabs but on the different sample days. This wasn't possible across all three sample days because of the splitting of the crabs into three different temperatures after the first sampling day. All crabs are immature males.
