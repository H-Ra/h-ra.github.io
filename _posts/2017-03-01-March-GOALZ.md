Here's my laundry list. Obviously, I like bullets:

  * Solidify personnel schedule for OA experiment through March, particularly HgCl injections during NSA conference  
  * Formulate plan/timeline for post-OA conditioning, spawning, setting, and rearing Oly's. Need to do this ASAP!  
  * Finish Pecan run! (ETA: Monday, March 6th)  
  * Figure out how to use Skyline  
  * Run files through Skyline, then figure out what to do next!  
  * Poster - draft background/methods by 3/10, add data and have full draft by 3/17. Complete by 3/24, then attend conference!  
  * Research background/context for DNR paper; begin writing.
  * Develop rough draft of Results section for DNR project
  * Draft & complete article for ComSciCon PNW, then attend
  * Finalize proposal for Proposal Writing Class, study for Invert Zoology etc., also Qsci 482.
