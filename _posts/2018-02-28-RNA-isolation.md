Today I began the process of isolating RNA from the "official" crab hemolymph samples, although they can change if I mess things up, because there are many extra samples. 

There are going to be 56 total samples (which will be pooled into 14), so I separated them into 7 groups of 8.

#### Mistakes were made during the first batch
I processed the first batch of 8, however at the last step of centrifuging in the [protocol](https://github.com/grace-ac/grace-ac.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-02-13-RNA-isolation-protocol-for-tomorrow.md) (Step 17) I realized I was off by a zero. Meaning, that when the protocol called for centrifuging at 12,000g, I actaully did it at 1,200 g. I'm not sure if this was the case the entire protocol through, or if I accidentally bumped it at some point. 

Regardless, I asked Sam what this means in terms of the potential success of the RNA isolation and he said that it could potentially be bad. The RNA needs to be spun at a certain speed in order to come out of solution, so if I was spinning them too slow, it could have been unsuccessful. 

However, I am going to run the Qubit on like three or four of the samples to see if anything came out. If not, then I'll have to pick 8 new samples to re-do it with and be EXTREMELY aware of the zeros on the centrifuge! Once this mistake was made, I will never not check the zeros at least three times.
