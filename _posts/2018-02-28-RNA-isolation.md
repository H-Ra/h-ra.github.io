Today I began the process of isolating RNA from the "official" crab hemolymph samples, although they can change if I mess things up, because there are many extra samples. 

There are going to be 56 total samples (which will be pooled into 14), so I separated them into 7 groups of 8.

I processed the first batch of 8, however at the last step of centrifuging in the protocol (Step 17) I realized I was off by a zero. Meaning, that when the protocol called for centrifuging at 12,000g, I actaully did it at 1,200 g. 

I asked Sam what this means in terms of the potential success of the RNA isolation and he said
